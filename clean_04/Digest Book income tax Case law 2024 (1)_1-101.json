The assessee contented that the land sold by him did not qualify as \"capital asset\" in terms of section 2(14)(iii) being rural agricultural land. The AO held that the land sold by the assessee as non agricultural land and concluded that it qualifies capital asset and therefore capital gained earned is liable to tax. Tribunal held that, AO has erred in interpreting S. 63AA of the Gujarat Tenancy and Agricultural land laws Act, 1997 and the land did not qualify capital asset in terms of s. 2(14)(iii) of the Act.

[S. 4, Art. 12, 14, 19, 226, 246, 265, 289] The assessee challenged the constitutional validity of section 2(24)(xviii) inserted by the Finance Act, 2015, which brought all forms of subsidies, grants, cash incentives, duty drawback, concessions and reimbursements within the ambit of taxable income, irrespective of whether capital or revenue in nature. It was contended that the amendment overruled judicial precedents applying the \"purpose test\" to subsidies, violated Articles 12, 14, 19, 246, 265 and 289 of the Constitution and was contrary to sections 4 and 5 of the Act. The High Court held that taxation is a matter of legislative policy; there is a presumption of constitutionality and courts cannot substitute legislative judgment in economic matters. Mere reduction in profitability or hardship to the assessee does not render a tax provision unconstitutional. The amendment was a transparent legislative act to recalibrate fiscal policy, and invalidation would cause fiscal chaos and refund claims. The provision was therefore upheld as constitutionally valid. Serum Institute of India (P.) Ltd. v. UOI [2023] 157 taxmann.com 107/ [2024] 463 ITR 582/336 CTR 6 (Bom) (HC)."

[S. 2(31), 22, 26, 167B(2)(i), 260A] Assessee and other co-owners purchased property in their names and thereafter constructed godowns and plinths which were rented out to two companies. Assessee received rental income from these companies and deposited it in a joint bank account held by all co-owners. Assessing Officer assessed rental income received by co-owners as income from AOP under section 4. Tribunal held that the Income was assessable as income of an AOP. On appeal the Court held that rental income being paid by Government companies jointly in hands of co-owners treating them as a single land lord and amount was also being deposited in single account. There was no defined share to rental income and AOP had jointly received income. Accordingly the rental income received by co-owners was to be assessed as income from AOP and not in hands of assessee as income from house property under section 22. (AY. 2005-06) Y.

Appellate Authority allowed claim of assessee. On appeal by the Revenue the Court held that since section 4A of U. P. Trade Tax Act, 1948 clearly indicated that exemption from tax on turnover of sales was not a subsidy granted by Government and section 4A had not authorised assessee either to collect tax component on exempted sales or to retain it, aforesaid amount of tax component was a revenue receipt in hands of assessee and it could not be treated as capital receipt.

[S. 28(i)] Assessee received subsidies from Govt. of West Bengal under West Bengal Incentive Scheme, 2004 for industrial projects. The Assessing Officer held that subsidy is revenue receipts. On appeal the Tribunal treated subsidy as capital in nature, intended for industrialization, and not taxable as revenue receipts. Tribunal also held that as per provisions of Industrial Promotion Assistance Scheme as framed by State of West Bengal, receipt of subsidies was clearly linked to a total investment exceeding INR 25,00,00,000 being made and would have become payable on commencement of commercial production.

The assessee along with its members decided to redevelop the flats by demolishing the old flats and constructing new flats. Accordingly it entered into redevelopment agreement with one developer, whereby it granted rights and entitlements to the developer for the aforesaid land. The members of the society agreed to transfer their old flats to the developer. The developer, in turn, agreed to pay a certain amount to each member of society apart from a certain amount to the corpus fund of assessee. The payment was in addition to the flats and parking spaces to be constructed and handed over to the members.

[S. 132, 260A] Assessees were trustees of certain educational trust. Said trust was taken over by certain church and assessees relinquished trusteeship of said trust in favour of trustees of said church, and received consideration for same. The Asseessing Officer assessed the receipt as income. CIT(A) confirmed the addition. Tribunal deleted the addition. On appeal the Court held that since no power was conferred on trustees to relinquish their position as trustees en banc, therefore, en banc resignation/relinquishment by assessees, of their position as trustees of Trust, that too for a consideration, could not get imprimatur of this Court. Therefore, consideration received for such relinquishment would not qualify as a capital receipt and would be treated as individual income of assessees. Assessing Officer held that assessees had received reimbursements of certain sum for construction expenses and brought same to tax in their individual hands. On appeal, Commissioner (Appeals) held that evidence obtained in course of search proceedings revealed that no construction work had actually been undertaken by said assessees or any of trustees, and hence, payments shown as contractual receipts were nothing but payments received for voluntary relinquishment of trusteeship. On appeal Tribunal held that there was construction activity carried out by those two assessees as evidenced by agreements and construction was reflected in balance sheet of assessees which was subjected to TDS and it could not be said that payments were not made towards construction of building which was for establishment of educational institution. On appeal the Court held that since Tribunal had relied on audited balance sheet of church and TDS payments made to Department in relation to said payments, the order of Tribunal is affirmed.

Assessing Officer placing reliance on provisions of section 90(4) rejected assessee's claim of exemption from taxation of salary in India and made an addition of same. CIT(A) held that the remuneration was paid by the employer who was is always a resident of India and therefore, the assessee's salary was taxable in India. On appeal the Tribunal held that the assessee had not made any submissions relating to status of assessee of cumulative stay of less than 365 days in four years preceding year in question, therefore, assessee by virtue of provisions of section 6(1) had failed to establish his status of non-resident.

Assessee contended that in case an enterprise at an entity level had suffered a loss at an entity level in relevant assessment year, no profit or income attribution would be warranted insofar as PE in India would be concerned. Court held that Article 7(1) constructs clear dichotomy between profits that may be earned by an enterprise on a global scale and those which are attributable to a PE situate in contracting state. It becomes further evident from Article 7(2) which stipulates that where an enterprise carries on business through a PE in other Contracting State, profits would be liable to be attributed to that PE as if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in similar activities and independent of enterprise of which it may be a part.

[S. 9(1)(vi), Art. 5(2)(a), 12] Assessee, a tax resident of UAE, entered into two Strategic Oversight Services Agreements (SOSA) with an Indian company in respect of hotel located at Delhi. In terms of SOSA, assessee agreed to provide strategic planning services and know-how to ensure that hotel was developed and operated as an efficient and high quality international full-service hotel and received fee (strategic fee as well as incentive fee) as set out in SOSA. Assessing Officer and Tribunal held that payment received from owner under SOSA was royalty under DTAA as same related to provisions of know-how, skill, experience, commercial information and other intangibles. The Court held that the fee was not a consideration for use of or right to use any process or for information of commercial or scientific experience but was in consideration of providing services as set out in SOSA. Therefore, fee revived by assessee was not royalty under article 12 of DTAA but was in nature of business income. Court also held that in terms of SOSA, assessee agreed to provide strategic planning services and know-how to ensure Hotel was developed and operated as an efficient and high quality international full-service hotel. Order of Tribunal holding that the assessee had a Permanent Establishment (PE) in terms of article 5(2) of DTAA was affirmed. Court observed that the assessee exercised control in respect of all activities at hotel, inter alia, by framing policies to be followed by hotel in respect of each and every activity, and by further exercising apposite control to ensure that said policies were duly implemented. Admittedly, assessee also performed an oversight function in respect of hotel which was also carried out, at least partially if not entirely, at hotel premises. Since hotel premises were at disposal of assessee in respect of its business activities, Tribunal had rightly held that assessee had a PE in India in form of fixed place through which it carried on its business.

[S. 90, Art. 4, 12] Assessee is a Limited Liability Company (LLC) incorporated in USA. Assessee claimed to be a resident of USA and offered to tax income by way of receipts on account of fees at rate of 15 per cent, applying rate given in India-USA DTAA. Assessing Officer held that LLCs were fiscally transparent entities according to US tax law, i. e., their income is not subject to tax in their own hands in USA and such corporations, therefore, did not qualify as residents of USA in terms of Article 4 of India-USA DTAA. He, accordingly, proceeded to bring to tax returned income of assessee at rate of 25 per cent. DRP affirmed the order of the AO. On appeal the Tribunal held that under US federal income tax law, an LLC with a single owner was disregarded as separate from its owner unless LLC elected to be treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes-Ability of LLC to elect its tax classification under US federal income tax law also supported legal situation or aspect of LLC being liable to tax. Further, where a LLC was disregarded as separate from its tax owner for US federal income tax purposes, tax owner of LLC paid tax on tax owner's share of taxable income attributed from LLC. Assessee being a resident under Article 4 of Indo-US Tax Treaty by virtue of incorporation and its recognition as a separate existence from its members qualified as a person. Accordingly the assessee was liable to tax in resident State by virtue of US Income-tax Law hence the tax authorities had fallen in error in not extending treaty benefit to assessee.

Instead, global travel agencies independently sourced these requirements.

[S. 9(1)(vi), Art. 7, 13(4), Copyright Act, 1957 13(1), 14(a)] Held that the role of the assessee was restricted to verification of the information concerning various candidates proposed to be hired by its clients. The information collected by the assessee was not protected by any copyright, but its circulation was regulated under the U. K., and other local laws, which cast a duty upon it to ensure the confidentiality of the reports as they contained details of the applicants. None of the requisites under article 13(3) of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement was satisfied so as to qualify such receipts as \"royalty\". The assessee was merely providing a report summarising its findings with respect to the background check undertaken by it, which report constituted factual data and could not per se qualify as literary, artistic or scientific work, patent, trademark, design, model, plan, secret formula or process or information. It did not fulfil the requirements enlisted under section 13(1)(a) of the Copyright Act, 1957. Moreover, none of the rights mentioned in section 14(a) thereof had been vested with the client by the assessee. The client did not have any right to publicly display, sell, distribute, copy, edit, modify or commercially exploit the report. The consideration received by the assessee was purely towards provision of background screening services and not for use, or right to use, any copyrightable material. Further, the assessee did not provide access to any database to its clients but only access to reports requisitioned by the client, in electronic form. Nothing had been brought on record by the Revenue to refute the assessee's claim. Online access to background screening results was not tantamount to providing access to the database maintained by the assessee. That the information obtained by the assessee from various sources was in the nature of factual data about prospective candidates, which did not involve imparting any kind of commercial experience, skill or expertise. It was a validation report assuring its client about the authenticity of the information contained therein. It did not involve any transfer of either commercial experience or the right to use the experience, nor transfer of any skill or knowledge of the assessee to the customers. As the assessee's services did not involve any technical skill, knowledge or consultancy or make available any technical knowledge, experience, skill, know-how or processes to the clients, the services should not be considered fees for technical services under article 13(4) of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. No addition could be made on account of royalty(AY. 2021-22)"

[Art. 12] Assessee, a Hong Kong based company, which is engaged in business of distribution of telecommunication products.

On 1-4-2018, an Explanation was inserted after section 10AA(1) by the Finance Act, 2017, with effect from the aforesaid date prospectively. On writ, the assessee contested the Explanation to section 10AA(1) inserted by the Finance Act, 2017 with prospective effect, as unconstitutional and allegedly violative of articles 14, 19(1)(g), and 265 of the Constitution of India. Court held that explanation after sub-section (1) of section 10AA, inserted by amendment with prospective effect from 1-4-2018, applicable in respect of the assessment year 2018-19 and subsequent years is constitutional and is a valid piece of legislation and is not arbitrary, discriminatory and is not violative of articles 14, 19 & 265 of the Constitution of India.

[S. 154] Assessee has joined as a technician in the central government department of telecom in the year 1981. The Government of India has corporatized the department of telecom into BSNL with effect from 1-10-2000. The assessee has credited 280 days of leave at the time of retirement for the service rendered department of telecom till the date of corporatization and claimed exemption of 280 days salary. The CPC calculated the exemption u/s 10(10AA) basing on the present declaration that the assessee was an employee of BSNL and hence the exemption u/s 10(10AA) was restricted to Rs. 3 lakhs. Rectification application was rejected. On appeal the Tribunal held that The CIT as well as the AO has not taken cognizance of these facts and wrongly denied the benefit of exemption of leave encashment u/s 10(10AA) of the Act.

[S. 11(1), 11(2), 11(3), 11(3)(d), 260A] The assessee-trust had accumulated income under section 11(2) and extended donations to other charitable trusts. The Assessing Officer held that extending donations to other charitable trusts would amount to utilization of the funds for a purpose other than those for which the surplus was accumulated under section 11(2) and thus being violative of section 11(3)(c) and section 11(3)(d). On appeal, the Commissioner (Appeals) held in favour of the assessee. On further appeal, the Tribunal affirmed the view taken by the Commissioner (Appeals). On appeal High Court affirmed the order of the Tribunal. (AY. 2009-10) CIT (E) v.

[S. 11(1)(a), S. 11 : Property held for charitable purposes. [S. 11(1)(d), 260A] Allowing the appeal the Court held that the amounts paid by the parents of the students admitted to the educational institution of the assessee-trust were payments towards corpus donation and were not collected by way of capitation fees. The Assessing Officer had not conducted any inquiry with regard to examination of parents who had admitted the students in school as to whether the payment was made towards corpus fund or capitation fee. Though it was true that the donation was bound to have been given for material gain in securing admission, it could not be characterised as donation towards charitable purpose and the assessee would not be entitled to have the benefit, but in the absence of any material on record, such view could not be taken. Therefore, the Tribunal had committed an error by treating the admission fees charged from the students as not forming part of the corpus fund of the trust. Therefore, the Tribunal was not justified in confirming the addition of the corpus fund to the income of the assessee by holding that the receipts could not be treated as corpus donation and not eligible for exemption under section 11(1)(d).

[S. 2(15), 12] Assessee, an apex sports body in India representing country, claimed exemption under sections 11 and 12. During the year, assessee entered into sponsorship agreements with few Indian business groups and received certain amount as sponsorships.

CIT(A) allowed the exemption. On appeal the Tribunal held that the assessee is representing country under aegis of Government in amateur international sports events and arranging these sponsorship contracts is in itself a great task for assessee as sponsors were paying out of their profits for motivating assessee and sportspersons of country in participating in international events.

On appeal the Tribunal held that from March, 2020 to March, 2022, country was passing through Covid Pandemic which restricted normal activities and it was also an accepted fact that many changes had been brought into Act regarding procedure of filing of income-tax return as well as audit reports and certain technical glitches had been faced time and again. Considering those aspects, CBDT authorized condonation of delays up to 365 days for assessment year 2018-19 onwards and by Circular No. 16/2022 dated 19- 07-2022 extended that to delays up to three years.

It had claimed exemption under section 11. Assessing Officer, rejected claim of exemption on ground that assessee-society was advancing object of general public utility and gross receipt of assessee from such activity was more than Rs. 10 lakhs in previous year and, therefore, activities of assessee were not for charitable purpose.
