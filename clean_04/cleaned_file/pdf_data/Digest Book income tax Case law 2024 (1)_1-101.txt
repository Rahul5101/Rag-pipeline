jurisdiction of Municipality-Population of village was 907 persons as per latest
published census of 2011-Long term capital gains on sale of agricultural land cannot
be taxed as capital gains. [S. 2(14)(iii)(a), 45, 54F]
Assessee sold agricultural land at Mohali in 2014 and claimed deduction u/s. 54B of
the Act by buying another agricultural land. AO considered agricultural land sold as
a capital asset by rejecting contention of the assessee that land sold was outside the
limits of the municipality and hence, it was exempt income. CIT(A) confirmed addition
made by the AO. On appeal the Tribunal deleted the addition by accepting the evidence
adduced by the assessee showing the population of the village was mere 907 persons as
per published census and that land was situated outside the limits of the municipality.
The long term capital gains on sale of land can could not be brought to tax. (AY. 2015-

purposes. Assessee has obtained certificate for change of land use from agricultural
to non-agricultural. The assessee contented that the land sold by him did not qualify
as "capital asset" in terms of section 2(14)(iii) being rural agricultural land. The AO
held that the land sold by the assessee as non agricultural land and concluded that it
qualifies capital asset and therefore capital gained earned is liable to tax. Tribunal held
that, AO has erred in interpreting S. 63AA of the Gujarat Tenancy and Agricultural land
laws Act,1997 and the land did not qualify capital asset in terms of s. 2(14)(iii) of the
Act. Accordingly the capital gains is not liable to tax. (AY. 2016-17)

S. 2(22)(e): Deemed dividend-Capital contribution by companies in which assessee
Firm's partners were shareholders-Commercial Transaction-Not loans and advances-
Not assessable as deemed dividend. [S. 260A]
During the year under consideration, the assessee-partnership firm received capital
contributions from two partner-companies in which two other partners held substantial
interest. The assessee was neither a registered shareholder nor a beneficial owner of
shares held in the companies. However, the assessing officer assessed the contributions
as deemed dividend under section 2(22)(e) and taxed the same in the hands of assessee.
The Commissioner of Income-Tax (Appeals) held that the capital contribution could not
be treated as loans or advances extended to the assessee and therefore, the assessing
officer could not have treated the same as deemed dividend in the hands of the assessee
and the same was upheld by the Tribunal. On appeal by the Department, the Delhi
High Court affirmed the decision of the Tribunal. The High Court further held that, if
at all addition could have been made, it could've been made in hands of two individual
partners and that too only by their assessing officers after affording them an opportunity
of being heard. (AY. 2006-07), 2010-11)

equity lent money to the assessee for making monthly payments to the bank. Business
nexus and business exigency of the entire transaction were proved, hence advance could
not be construed as the receipt of a dividend. (AY. 2012-13)

Apeejay P. Ltd. v. Dy. CIT (2024) 111 ITR 231 (Kol.) (Trib.)
S. 2(22)(e) : Deemed dividend-Loans and advances-From group company (APL)-
Beneficial shareholder was KSWPL under whose controlling interest and influence,
APL. had given loan/advance to assessee-Deeming provisions of section 2(22)(e) under
second limb were attracted on KSWPL and not on assessee-loan amount was not
taxable in hands of assesse. [S. 5 (1)(b)]
The assesseee was not a registered share holder of APL who was lender company.
Assessee received certain sum as loans/advances from its group company (APL).
Assessing Officer treated amount of loans/advances received by assessee from APL
as deemed dividend under section 2(22)(e) on ground that there was a common
shareholding by KSWPL having substantial interest in both APL and assessee. CIT(A)
affirmed the order of the Assessing Officer. On appeal the Tribunal held that KSWPL
was in a position to control affairs of both APL and assessee. Benefit of transaction
between APL and assessee accrued to KSWPL who was in a controlling position having
more than 20 per cent of shareholding in both of them-Assessee and APL were in no
way in a position to compel KSWPL in any way for exercising its voting rights in a
particular manner. Thus, beneficial shareholder was KSWPL under whose controlling
interest and influence, APL had given loan/advance to assessee and, accordingly,
deeming provisions of section 2(22)(e) under second limb were attracted on KSWPL.
Further, taking into consideration provisions contained in section 5(1)(b), income
accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise in hands of KSWPL and not in hands
of assessee and same was not taxable in hands of assessee. Addition was deleted. (AY.

Apeejay Surrendra Management Services (P.) Ltd. v. DCIT (2024) 205 ITD 737 (Kol) (Trib.)
S. 2(24)(xviii) : Income - Subsidy - Incentives - Constitutional validity - Finance
Act, 2015 - All subsidies, grants, incentives, concessions, reimbursements etc. to be
treated as income - Court cannot substitute legislative judgment of economic policies
- Validity upheld. [S. 4, Art. 12, 14, 19, 226, 246, 265, 289]
The assessee challenged the constitutional validity of section 2(24)(xviii) inserted by
the Finance Act, 2015, which brought all forms of subsidies, grants, cash incentives,
duty drawback, concessions and reimbursements within the ambit of taxable income,
irrespective of whether capital or revenue in nature. It was contended that the
amendment overruled judicial precedents applying the "purpose test" to subsidies,
violated Articles 12, 14, 19, 246, 265 and 289 of the Constitution and was contrary to
sections 4 and 5 of the Act. The High Court held that taxation is a matter of legislative
policy; there is a presumption of constitutionality and courts cannot substitute
legislative judgment in economic matters. Mere reduction in profitability or hardship to
the assessee does not render a tax provision unconstitutional. The amendment was a
transparent legislative act to recalibrate fiscal policy, and invalidation would cause fiscal
chaos and refund claims. The provision was therefore upheld as constitutionally valid.

is applicable from assessment year 2015-16-Shares held around 31 months-Matter
remanded to decide issue afresh as per provisions of law. [S. 45, 54F]
Assessee sold shares and earned LTCG and claimed deduction under section 54F. Assessing
Officer denied exemption under section 54F on ground that period of holding of shares was
less than 36 months i. e. 31 months. Drawing support from provisions of section 2(42A),
Assessing Officer held that sale of shares gave rise to STCG and taxed same. CIT(A) affirmed
the order of the AO. On appeal the Tribunal held that since provisions of section 2(42A)
has been amended to exclude holding period of unlisted shares being held for 12 months
to be treated as LTCG but said amendment has come from assessment year 2015-16 and
applicable therefrom therefore, amended provisions is not applicable. Since holding period
of impugned shares was around 31 months, capital gain was to be treated as LTCG and,
hence, Assessing Officer should re-consider claim of exemption under section 54F and
decide issue afresh as per provisions of law. (AY. 2013-14)

S. 4 : Charge of income-tax-Capital or revenue-Sales tax exemption -Notice is issued
in SLP filed by the assessee. [U. P. Trade Tax Act, 1948, S. 4A, Art. 136]
High Court held that the assessee availed exemption from payment of tax under
exemption certificate issued under section 4A of U. P. Trade Tax Act, 1948 on turnover
of sales and claimed amount representing tax exemption component as capital receipt,
since section 4A clearly indicated that exemption from tax on turnover of sales was not
a subsidy granted by Government, aforesaid amount of tax component was a revenue
receipt in hands of assessee and it could not be treated as capital receipt. Whether in
view of fact that issue regarding exemption granted under U. P. Trade Tax, 1948, and
effect thereof was pending consideration before this Court in Tata Steel BSL Ltd. v. CIT

was not a subsidy granted by Government and section 4A had not authorised assessee
either to collect tax component on exempted sales or to retain it, aforesaid amount of

Incentives put in place by the Government of Maharashtra, as indicated above, in 1964.
The 1993 Scheme was forged to achieve three broad objectives : (i) first, to disperse
industries outside the now Mumbai-Thane-Pune belt and to attract new and expanded
units to developing and underdeveloped areas of the State ; (ii) second, to rationalise
incentives accorded by intensifying and accelerating the dispersal of units from
developed to underdeveloped and developing areas ; and (iii) third, the development
of underdeveloped regions of the State, particularly those which were at some distance
from the Mumbai-Thane-Pune belt. Thus, the central theme, object and purpose of the
1993 Scheme was to industrialise underdeveloped and developing areas which fell
outside the now Mumbai-Thane-Pune belt by incentivising the setting up of new and
expanded units. The common thread running through various incentives provided under
the scheme was the setting up of new units or large-scale investment in fixed capital.
The fact that the eligibility certificate was to be issued by the agency implementing
the scheme after the commencement of commercial production by the eligible unit had
been incorporated in the 1993 Scheme to ensure that the object and the purpose of the
1993 Scheme, which was to industrialise underdeveloped and developing areas was
fulfilled. Dismissing the appeal of the Revenue the Court held that the assessee was
entitled to avail of sales-tax subsidy and incentives under two eligibility certificates
dated December 13, 1994 and October 15, 1996 (as amended) for 14 years and 13 years
and 11 months, respectively, subject to a maximum entitlement of 110 per cent. of the
capital investment made in setting up of the industrial units. A perusal of the eligibility
certificate dated December 13, 1994 would show that it was issued for setting up a "new
unit", while the eligibility certificate dated October 15, 1996 was given to a "pioneer
unit" which had undertaken expansion. The sales tax subsidy or incentive received by
the assessee under 1993 Scheme was a capital receipt. (AY. 1997-98, 2005-06, 2006-07,

S. 4 : Charge of income-tax-Interest-Capital or revenue-Auction sale-Interest against
principal amount deposited-Auction sale is nullified by court-Interest is capital receipt
and cannot be assessed as income from other sources. [S. 56(2)(viii)]
Assessee deposited principal amount pursuant to auction sale. However, said auction
was eventually nullified by court. High Court directed for refund of whole amount
deposited by assessee along with interest accrued thereon. Assessing Officer made
addition on account of amount of interest received by assessee under section 56(2)(viii)
of the Act. CIT(A) affirmed the order of the Assessing Officer. Assessee contended that

26

S. 4 Charge of income-tax
said amount of interest was in nature of capital receipt not chargeable to tax. Tribunal
held that principal amount could not be characterized as compensation granted by Court
on account of cancellation of auction. Rather, such an amount was a bonafide amount
of successful auction bidder, which he had deposited against purchase of land. Amount
so received by assessee was entitlement of successful bidder which was given back to
assessee vide an order of Court. Thus, when amount was not in nature of compensation,
then, as a natural corollary, interest accrued on said amount could not tantamount to
revenue receipts, and hence, same could not be subjected to tax as per section 56(2)
(viii) of the Act. On appeal by Revenue High Court affirmed the order of the Tribunal.

S. 4: Charge of income-tax-Subsidy-Capital or revenue-Bengal Incentive Scheme,
2004-Linked to establishment of new units-Capital in nature. [S. 28(i)]
Assessee received subsidies from Govt. of West Bengal under West Bengal Incentive
Scheme, 2004 for industrial projects. The Assessing Officer held that subsidy is revenue
receipts. On appeal the Tribunal treated subsidy as capital in nature, intended for
industrialization, and not taxable as revenue receipts. Tribunal also held that as per
provisions of Industrial Promotion Assistance Scheme as framed by State of West Bengal,
receipt of subsidies was clearly linked to a total investment exceeding INR 25,00,00,000
being made and would have become payable on commencement of commercial
production. Affirming the order of the Tribunal the Court held that since, subsidy being
clearly linked to establishment of new units, it would be treated as capital in nature.
As regards the issue of Advertainment, Marketing and Promotion ("AMP"), the appeals
would be re-notified, since both sides seek an opportunity to address submissions in
greater detail.

S. 4: Charge of income-tax-Income -Redevelopment agreement-Amount paid to
members of society-Members offered the amount for taxation-Not taxable in the
assessee society-Possession not given-Not taxable as capital gain in the year under
consideration. [S. 2(24), 5, 45, 56 260A]
The assessee-society owned certain residential flats. The plot of land on which the said
flats were constructed was held by the assessee as a lessee under a long-term lease. The
assessee along with its members decided to redevelop the flats by demolishing the old
flats and constructing new flats. Accordingly it entered into redevelopment agreement
with one developer, whereby it granted rights and entitlements to the developer for
the aforesaid land. The members of the society agreed to transfer their old flats to the
developer. The developer, in turn, agreed to pay a certain amount to each member of
society apart from a certain amount to the corpus fund of assessee. The payment was
in addition to the flats and parking spaces to be constructed and handed over to the
members. The Assessing Officer taxed the amount received by the members from the
developer in the hands of the assessee. The Commissioner (Appeals) partly allowed
the appeal of the assessee. The Tribunal, on appeals filed by both the assessee and
10

Charge of income-tax S. 4
the revenue, held that the facts in the instant case were almost similar to the facts in
the case of CIT v. Raj Ratan Palace Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. [IT Appeal No.
2292 of 2011, dated 27-2-2013 (Bombay High Court)] and relying on the said judgment
concluded that as the members of the society had offered the amount received by them
from the developer for taxation, the Commissioner (Appeals) was not justified in taxing
the aforesaid amount to some extent in the hands of the assessee, as the same was the
income of the members. It accordingly allowed the appeal of the assessee and dismissed
the appeal of the revenue. Dismissing the appeal the Court held that the revenue is not
even questioning the finding of the Tribunal that the facts in the case at hand were
almost similar to the facts in the case of Raj Ratan Palace CHS (supra). Further against
the above order of the High Court, the revenue had preferred a Special Leave Petition
in the Apex Court, which came to be dismissed. Followed, CIT v. Raj Ratan Palace

S. 4: Charge of income-tax-Consideration received for relinquishment of trustee 30
ship-Not capital in nature-Assessable as income-Reimbursements of certain sum for
construction expenses-Not taxable in the hands of trustees-Not taxable in the hands
of trustees-Donations were received by trusts-Not taxable in the hands of the Trustees.
[S. 132, 260A]
Assessees were trustees of certain educational trust. Said trust was taken over by certain
church and assessees relinquished trusteeship of said trust in favour of trustees of said
church, and received consideration for same. The Asseessing Officer assessed the receipt
as income. CIT(A) confirmed the addition. Tribunal deleted the addition. On appeal the
Court held that since no power was conferred on trustees to relinquish their position
as trustees en banc, therefore, en banc resignation/relinquishment by assessees, of their
position as trustees of Trust, that too for a consideration, could not get imprimatur of
this Court. Therefore, consideration received for such relinquishment would not qualify
as a capital receipt and would be treated as individual income of assessees. Assessing
Officer held that assessees had received reimbursements of certain sum for construction
expenses and brought same to tax in their individual hands. On appeal, Commissioner
(Appeals) held that evidence obtained in course of search proceedings revealed that no
construction work had actually been undertaken by said assessees or any of trustees,
and hence, payments shown as contractual receipts were nothing but payments received
for voluntary relinquishment of trusteeship. On appeal Tribunal held that there was
construction activity carried out by those two assessees as evidenced by agreements and
construction was reflected in balance sheet of assessees which was subjected to TDS
and it could not be said that payments were not made towards construction of building
which was for establishment of educational institution. On appeal the Court held that
since Tribunal had relied on audited balance sheet of church and TDS payments made
to Department in relation to said payments, the order of Tribunal is affirmed. Donations
were received by certain trust in which assessees were trustees. AO taxed same in hands
of assessees. CIT(A) affirmed the Order of the Assessing Officer. Tribunal deleted the

addition. On appeal the Court held that payments were actually made to trust and not
to trustees in their individual names and therefore, same could not be taxed in hands
of assessees. (AY. 2009-10 to 2011-12)

Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) (Amendment) Act, 1974, is completely
controlled financially as well as administratively by the State Government and
consequently, it falls within the definition of 'State' under Art. 12 of the Constitution

capital receipt is not taxable. [S. 4, 28(ii)(e),32(1)(iv), 56(2)(xi), Industrial Relations
Code, 2020, S. 2(ZA)]
The assessee has received compensation from Spiegel Verlag Spiegel Publishers which
she claimed as exempt under section 4 of the Income tax Act. The AO held that the
compensation is taxable as business income under section 28(ii)(e) of the Act read with
Board Circular No. 8/2018 dt. 26 December, 2018 (2019) 306 CTR 21 (St). The AO also
held that said compensation is also taxable under section 56(2)(xi) of the Act. CIT(A)

35

--- Page 14 ---
S. 4 Charge of income-tax
the compensation for termination compensation received by any person on termination
or modification of the terms and conditions of any contract relating to his business
is taxable under the head Profits and gains of business or profession. Wherever the
legislature thought of referring to both business and profession, it has used both the
words in the enactment. This means that wherever the word only business is used, it
does not include profession. The reference to business in S. 28(ii)(e) would not amount
to reference to profession. On the facts of the case the assessee is a freelance journalist.
Relevant clauses of the agreement refer to renewal of the agreement. Since the contract
was not renewed, it came to an end. Compensation was received by the assessee by
way of mutual agreement between Spiegel Verlag Spiegel Publishers and the assessee.
As per S. 2(zh) of the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, non-renewal of any contract does
not amount to retrenchment. Therefore the compensation received by the assessee is not
taxable under S. 28(ii)(e). In S. 56(2)(xi) the reference is to termination of employment.
This section is also not applicable on the facts of the case. Followed G. K. Choksi &
Co. v. CIT (2007) 213 CTR 431 / 295 ITR 376 (SC). Accordingly the compensation being
capital receipt is not taxable. (AY. 2020-21)

Collective investment schemes(CIS)-Advances for sales-Deposits-The deposits received
from the members cannot be treated as revenue receipt-Capital receipt. [S. 40(a)(ia),
145, 1944, 195]
The assessee is involved in the business of selling holiday membership plans to its
members. It had certain affiliation with certain hotels which provided accommodation to
its members. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) vide order dt. 21 st August,
2015 held that schemes floated and prescribed by the assssee constitute Collective
Investment Schemes (CIS). Only 2% of the members /investors have availed of the
holiday facilities other 98% investors who have invested money with the sole motive of
receiving the assured returns in the form of interest. The assesee has not deducted the
tax at source. The AO assessed the deposit as income and also disallowed the interest
for failure to deduct tax at source. CIT(A) affirmed the order of the AO. On appeal the
Tribunal held that the schemes floated by the assessee were held to be in the nature
of CIS and therefore, the NAC paid by the assessee to its members was considered as
interest on deposits, such deposits by the members cannot be treated as revenue in the
hands of the assessee. The deposits received from the members cannot be treated as
revenue receipt in the hands of the assessee. Tribunal also held that it is trite law that
entries in the books of account are not decisive or determinative of the true nature of
the entries. Accordingly the amount received by the assessee from its members, to the
extent the same is treated as income in its books of account, is directed to be reduced
while calculating the total income of the assessee. (AY. 2009-10 to 2015-16)

Held that as the information was available before the Assessing Officer, there could not
be any violation of rule 46A; secondly, the sum was received on account of capital
receipt on sale of hotel assets and could not be treated as business asset. Such amount
represented sale consideration as against sale of capital asset and should be adjusted

Held that the interest earned from the unutilised grant-in-aid is also a part of the grant-
in-aid and was not income under the provisions of the Act, and there being no materials
to take a different view, the order of the Commissioner (Appeals) is affirmed. Fact that

lawns facility by non-members are not covered by principle of mutuality-Income from
such activity is not exempt. [S. 143(3)]
Held that the facts were that the booking was done in the name of the member clearly
mentioning the fact of the usage of facility by an outsider or non-member, the liability
15

44

S. 4
Charge of income-tax
for payment for the usage of the facility was raised in the account of the member,
and the facility was utilised by non-members or guests, and payment also was made
by the guests or non-members. The fact that the non-members paid for the usage of
these facilities was a clear pointer to the fact that the facility was given to the non-
members not on behalf of the members as their guests but for the benefit of the non-
members alone. Clearly the member was only a name lender, a conduit. His role ended
with the lending of his name, the facility was thereafter utilised by non-member on
making payment. The mere fact that the club held the member liable for making the
payment, did not take away the fact that in every such letting out to non-members,
the payment invariably was made by the non-members. There was no doubt, therefore,
that the letting out of these facilities to non-members was not for the contributors in
the common fund of the assessee club. In other years, before the Tribunal, it was noted
that the facilities had been extended to the non-members on the behest of the members
as his guests and the fact that the payment was being made by non-members was not
brought to the knowledge of the Tribunal; and, therefore, it proceeded with the belief
that the extension of the facility to non-members was for and on behalf of the members
itself. Since the facility was not being given to the non-members for and on behalf of
the member, but was being exclusively given to the non-members alone, the usage of the
air-conditioned hall and lawns facility by non-members in the facts of the present case
was not covered by the principle of mutuality. (AY. 2008-09, 2012-13, 2013-14, 2015-16)

The Assessing Officer had made an addition of the commission earned on guarantee
issued by the bank relating to the unexpired period of the guarantee contract during
the year but offered to tax by the assessee in succeeding years over the period of the
guarantee. Likewise, an addition was also made on account of interest income on
non-performing assets. The Dispute Resolution Panel, though noting that an identical
addition of commission income made in the preceding years stood deleted by the
Tribunal, directed the Assessing Officer to make the addition for the reason that the
Department had appealed the Tribunal's decision before the the High Court. Neither the
Dispute Resolution Panel, nor the assessee, had brought out any distinction in facts from
the preceding years. Therefore, as there was no case made out by the Revenue for not
applying the Tribunal's decision in favour of the assessee, the addition of commission
income and of interest income from non-performing assets is directed to be deleted.

Interest income earned on fixed deposits pertaining to period prior to commencement

Held that where assessee-company had not commenced its business activities during
relevant financial year and earned interest income on fixed deposits made by it in
earlier years, interest income earned on fixed deposits pertaining to period prior to
commencement of business was in nature of capital receipt and pre-operative expenses
of assessee had to be adjusted with this "capital receipt" and only balance expense,

Assessee had made a claim with insurance company on basis of insurance cover
purchased by it in respect of its corporate office where fire took place and had received
interim claim of Rs. 2. 75 crores and it had incurred loss. Assessing Officer had treated
payment received by assessee as insurance claim on ad hoc basis and taxed same under
head business or profession. Commissioner (Appeals) held that amount received by
assessee was revenue receipt taxable under head business or profession. On appeal the
Assessee contended that since assessee had ultimately incurred a loss, said receipt could
not be taxed in its hand as revenue receipt. Tribunal held that since assessee did not
produce evidence regarding loss incurred by it due to accidental fire, issue was to be
remitted back to Assessing Officer to decide afresh for on verifying actual loss incurred

under the purview of the income within the meaning of section 2(24) of the Act. The
hardship compensation is a capital receipt hence not taxable. The Tribunal has relied
on various judgements of the Tribunal and deleted the addition. (AY. 2012-13, 2015-16,

Where the assessee had terminated the sub-lease and filed a suit for eviction, while the
tenant also filed a cross-suit, the Small Causes Court permitted the tenant to deposit
lease rent in Court without prejudice to the rights of either party. Since the dispute
regarding the subsistence of lease was sub judice and the assessee had not accepted
rent after termination, the right to receive rent was in jeopardy. Income could not be
said to have accrued to the assessee till final adjudication by the Court. Hence, the

entered into redevelopment agreement with a developer to redevelop flats and granted
rights and entitlements to developer for aforesaid land. Developer agreed to pay Rs.
15 crores to corpus fund of assessee and an amount of Rs. 3.50 crores was paid on
execution of agreement. Assessing Officer held that amount of Rs. 15 crores was just a
receipt of non-recurring nature and taxed entire amount under head income from other
sources during year under consideration. Dismissing the appeal of the Revenue the Court
held that since assessee had not given possession of land to developer during year under
consideration amount of Rs. 3.50 crores (real income) only could be taxed for year under
consideration. Followed, CIT v. Raj Ratan Palace Co-Operative Housing Society Ltd, ITA

(i), Art. 4(2)(a)]
Assessee had a permanent home in India as well as in USA. Assessee claimed that his
centre of vital interest lay in USA as his family was US national holding US passport, he
was overseas citizen of India, had larger investments in US and one daughter out of three
children was studying in USA. Assessing Officer held that assessee had stayed in India
for more than 183 days and he was staying with his wife and children who had shown
their place of residence as India. He treated assessee as resident of India for tax purposes
and his US income was also taxed in India under section 5. CIT(A) up held the order
of the AO. On appeal the Tribunal held that the assessee had a home in India. Assessee
had come back to India for carrying on business in a private limited company which
was set up by him and his wife. Assessee had an active involvement in running of this
company in India. In India he had operative bank accounts and he had also investment in
mutual funds. From USA, assessee was deriving rental income where his house property
was rented out, he had investments in bank accounts as well as alternative investments.
He did not have any active involvement in USA for earning wages, remuneration, profit
Personal relationship and economic relationship of assessee and tilt more in favour of
being close to India than US and thus, assessee was held as a resident of India in terms of
article 4(2)(a) of Indo-(USA). Consequently, all his income derived in USA, was chargeable
to tax in India by virtue of provisions of section 5. (AY. 2013-14)

Resident salary received by assessee while rendering service abroad not taxable in
India-DTAA-India-United Kingdom. [S. 5(2)(b), Art, 16]
Held Allowing the appeal, the Tribunal held that the assessee was a non-resident
employee in an Indian company and was sent abroad to the United Kingdom for
rendering services there. Service was rendered in the United Kingdom though the
appointment made in India. The assessee received total salary which the assessee offered
to tax in the United Kingdom. The Income-tax return and certificate of residence had
been placed on record. The assessee claimed relief under the Double Taxation Avoidance
Agreement between India and the United Kingdom which was not allowed for the want
of tax residency certificate by the Assessing Officer. Once the assessee qualified to be
treated as non-resident under section 6 of the Act the scope of income taxable in the
hands of the assessee would be in terms of section 5(2)(b) of the Act. The assessee was
a non-resident and therefore the salary received by the assessee while rendering service
abroad was not taxable in India. The addition was deleted. (AY. 2014-15)

Assessee, a tax resident of both India and US, employed with Indian-company was
on an international assignment to US. He stayed and exercised his employment in US
and received salary income. He claimed that as he had stayed in India only for 16
days, salary income earned by him was not taxable in India but was taxable in USA
as per provisions of article 16 of Indo-US DTAA. Assessing Officer placing reliance on
provisions of section 90(4) rejected assessee's claim of exemption from taxation of salary
in India and made an addition of same. CIT(A) held that the remuneration was paid by
the employer who was is always a resident of India and therefore, the assessee's salary
was taxable in India. On appeal the Tribunal held that the assessee had not made any
submissions relating to status of assessee of cumulative stay of less than 365 days in
four years preceding year in question, therefore, assessee by virtue of provisions of
section 6(1) had failed to establish his status of non-resident. During year, assessee did
not have permanent home in US, whereas, he had a permanent home in India. The
Assesseee is in permanent employment of Indian-company and bank account of assessee
i also in India, wherein, salary is deposited. Address of wife of assessee mentioned in
income tax return filed in USA for year 2019 is also in India. In view of provisions of
section 6 read with article 4 of Indo-US DTAA, assessee is to be treated as a resident of
India. Since assessee is a resident of India, however he had exercised employment and
received remuneration in US, income of assessee is taxable in USA and not in India.
Therefore, additions made by Assessing Officer is deleted. (AY. 2019-20)

Assessee was asked to furnish documents in support of his residential status. On the basis of documents it was observed that the assessee stayed in India for 176 days and went to Mauritius during the year. The AO assessed the assessee as resident.

High Court also held that where MIPL was not performing additional function, in absence of material, it could not be taken as dependant agency PE to assessee liable to tax in India.

terms of Article 24(2) of DTAA between India and Netherlands, containing provision
of non-discrimination, assessee is liable to Income Tax at rate applicable to a domestic
company. It was found that Explanation to section 90 is not in conflict with provisions
of DTAA and that there is no conflict between provisions of DTAA and Income-tax Act,
1961 regarding non-discrimination. Further, section 2(17) defining word 'Company',
section 2(22A) defining word Domestic Company', section 2(23A) defining word 'Foreign
Company', and section 90 of Act, 1961 read with Explanation and section 2(1), section
2(12)(a), Paragraph 'E' of First Schedule to Finance Act are plain, unambiguous and lead
only to one conclusion that two classes of companies, namely, 'domestic company' and
'company other than a domestic company' are liable to tax at prescribed rates. Therefore,
there being no ambiguity in classification and rates of tax, assessee, which was not a
'domestic company', was liable to tax at rates prescribed for a company 'other than a
domestic company'.

Establishment-Apportionment of income-Where an assessee had a Permanent
Establishment in India, it would be liable to pay tax on income attributable to that PE
notwithstanding that assessee at an entity level had suffered a loss-DTAA-India-UAE.
[Art. 5, 7(1), 7(2)]
The Full Bench was constituted to decide one of the questions arising in the petitions
is whether any taxable income can be attributed to the Permanent Establishment (PE)
in India if the overseas entity has incurred a loss in the relevant assessment year.
Assessee contended that in case an enterprise at an entity level had suffered a loss
at an entity level in relevant assessment year, no profit or income attribution would
be warranted insofar as PE in India would be concerned. Court held that Article 7(1)
constructs clear dichotomy between profits that may be earned by an enterprise on
a global scale and those which are attributable to a PE situate in contracting state. It
becomes further evident from Article 7(2) which stipulates that where an enterprise
carries on business through a PE in other Contracting State, profits would be liable to
be attributed to that PE as if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in similar
activities and independent of enterprise of which it may be a part. Article 7(1) itself
excludes profits of an enterprise from being subjected to tax till such time as such an

entity carries on no business in other Contracting State through a PE. The fact that a
PE was conceived to be an independent taxable entity could not be questioned. Article
7 cannot be viewed as restricting right of source State to allocate or attribute income to
PE based on global income or loss that may have been earned or incurred by a cross
border entity. Thus, where an assessee had a PE in India, it would be liable to pay tax
on income attributable to that PE notwithstanding that assessee at an entity level had
suffered a loss. The matters are placed before the appropriate Roster Bench for disposal
of petitions. (AY. 2009-10 to 2017-18)

S. 9(1)(i): Income deemed to accrue or arise in India-Business connection-Strategic
Oversight services-Not royalty-Business income-Since hotel premises were at disposal
of assessee in respect of its business activities, Tribunal had rightly held that assessee
had a PE in India in form of fixed place through which it carried on its business-
DTAA-India-UAE. [S. 9(1)(vi), Art. 5(2)(a), 12]
Assessee, a tax resident of UAE, entered into two Strategic Oversight Services
Agreements (SOSA) with an Indian company in respect of hotel located at Delhi. In
terms of SOSA, assessee agreed to provide strategic planning services and know-how
to ensure that hotel was developed and operated as an efficient and high quality
international full-service hotel and received fee (strategic fee as well as incentive fee)
as set out in SOSA. Assessing Officer and Tribunal held that payment received from
owner under SOSA was royalty under DTAA as same related to provisions of know-how,
skill, experience, commercial information and other intangibles. The Court held that the
fee was not a consideration for use of or right to use any process or for information of
commercial or scientific experience but was in consideration of providing services as
set out in SOSA. Therefore, fee revived by assessee was not royalty under article 12 of
DTAA but was in nature of business income. Court also held that in terms of SOSA,
assessee agreed to provide strategic planning services and know-how to ensure Hotel
was developed and operated as an efficient and high quality international full-service
hotel. Order of Tribunal holding that the assessee had a Permanent Establishment (PE)
in terms of article 5(2) of DTAA was affirmed. Court observed that the assessee exercised
control in respect of all activities at hotel, inter alia, by framing policies to be followed
by hotel in respect of each and every activity, and by further exercising apposite control
to ensure that said policies were duly implemented. Admittedly, assessee also performed
an oversight function in respect of hotel which was also carried out, at least partially
if not entirely, at hotel premises. Since hotel premises were at disposal of assessee in
respect of its business activities, Tribunal had rightly held that assessee had a PE in
India in form of fixed place through which it carried on its business. (AY. 2009-10 to

debit notes furnished provided sufficient information as to nature of duties and
number of hours spent-Order of Tribunal deleting the disallowance is affirmed-Article
7 of OECD Model Convention. [S. 260A]

Dismissing the appeal of the Revenue the Court held that, the involvement of the assessee
in the project which was under execution was not in doubt. The DMRC had availed the
engineering services rendered by the employees of the head office. The assessee only
remitted the engineering fee to the head office. There is no dispute with regard to the fact
that the debit note provided sufficient information not only concerning the names of the
employees but also as to the nature of duties and number of hours that they spent on the
job assigned to them. As the Tribunal was being the final fact-finding authority, hence no
interference was called for, especially when revenue had not proposed any question which
was indicative of the fact that any of the findings returned by the Tribunal was perverse.
Therefore Disallowance was correctly deleted. (AY. 2005-06)

which operates from 1-4-1962-OECD Model Convention, Art 13. [S. 260A]

The assessee, a Singapore based company, had invested in equity and preference shares
of 'A', a company incorporated in and resident of Singapore. On 27-3-2015, the assessee
sold its entire shareholding in 'A' to 'J' (an Indian company). The Assessing Officer
computed the long-term capital gains arising from the transfer of shares of 'A' and
proposed addition. The assessee submitted that Explanation 7 of section 9(1)(i) ought
to have been given retrospective effect. The DRP up held the addition. Tribunal deleted
the impugned addition holding that Explanations 4 and 5 inserted via the Finance Act,
2012 would operate retrospectively with effect from 1-4-1962. On appeal High Court up

Korea. [S. 234B,260A, Art. 7]

Dismissing the appeal of the Revenue the Court held that, though assessee had entered
into a contract with MRVC for the supply of equipment and services, offshore as well as
onshore, the terms of the contract distinctly set out the quantum of offshore supplies to
be made by the assessee to MRVC and also the quantum of payment to be received by
the assessee from MRVC outside India. The composite contract specifically records the
quantum of goods to be supplied outside India, the property in the plant and machinery
got transferred to MRVC once they were loaded on the mode of transport from the
country of origin to India and even the payment is made outside India. Therefore the
income arising from offshore supplies is not taxable in India. (AY. 2012-13)

Held that as per art. 1 of memorandum of agency agreement, the appointment of the
Indian subsidiary as agent was for the purpose of performing the functions as selling

of goods. Article 1 itself mentions that the assessee-company as a principal reserves the
right to quote price, place orders of the goods and otherwise deal directly with buyers
and/or sellers located in the territory or visiting Japan from the territory, if all the
actions of the assessee as principal, circumstances make it necessary advisable to do so.
Because the nature of business of trading is a continuous flow of the business process,
that cannot be a foundation to conclude a principal-agent relationship for the purpose

any activity, either wholly or partly in relation to sale of software licence through the
alleged PE in India so as to satisfy the conditions of art. 5(1) r/w art. 5(2) of the tax

Following the order of Tribunal for earlier year the Tribunal held that section 44BBB

split for gaining any tax advantage as alleged by the Revenue, that there is no business
connection of the assessee in India, that there did not exist a fixed place permanent
establishment or construction permanent establishment of the assessee in India, and
that, therefore, the addition made by the Assessing Officer was deleted. Levy of interest

S. 9(1)(i): Income deemed to accrue or arise in India-Business connection-Limited
Liability Company (LLC)-Resident of USA State by virtue of US Income-tax Law-
Qualified as a person under Article 4 of Indo-US Tax Treaty-Eligible for treaty benefit-
Liable to tax at 15% and not 25%-DTAA-India-USA. [S. 90, Art. 4, 12]
Assessee is a Limited Liability Company (LLC) incorporated in USA. Assessee claimed
to be a resident of USA and offered to tax income by way of receipts on account of fees
at rate of 15 per cent, applying rate given in India-USA DTAA. Assessing Officer held
that LLCs were fiscally transparent entities according to US tax law, i. e., their income is
not subject to tax in their own hands in USA and such corporations, therefore, did not
qualify as residents of USA in terms of Article 4 of India-USA DTAA. He, accordingly,
proceeded to bring to tax returned income of assessee at rate of 25 per cent. DRP
affirmed the order of the AO. On appeal the Tribunal held that under US federal income
tax law, an LLC with a single owner was disregarded as separate from its owner unless
LLC elected to be treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes-Ability of
LLC to elect its tax classification under US federal income tax law also supported legal
situation or aspect of LLC being liable to tax. Further, where a LLC was disregarded
as separate from its tax owner for US federal income tax purposes, tax owner of LLC
paid tax on tax owner's share of taxable income attributed from LLC. Assessee being
a resident under Article 4 of Indo-US Tax Treaty by virtue of incorporation and its
recognition as a separate existence from its members qualified as a person. Accordingly
the assessee was liable to tax in resident State by virtue of US Income-tax Law hence
the tax authorities had fallen in error in not extending treaty benefit to assessee. (AY.

Held that under the licence agreement no rights were provided to make copies of
software products or to modify, merge or combine with other software; no right to
change the object code from source code and make any derivative products from
that had been provided and the technical documentation for the software remained
the property of the assessee, the assessee was responsible for any claims of patent
infringement and thus all intellectual property rights in the licensed products belonged
to the assessee and its licensors only. The Indian company was required to get the terms
of the legally binding end user licence agreement agreed by its customer before allowing
use of the licensed products. The Indian company merely purchased the licensed
software which was embedded in the head unit and fitted into cars for end use by the
buyer of the car. The end user licence agreement was signed with the end user for use
of the licensed software. The end user had limited right to use the application. The
receipts from supply of software were not royalty income. The expression "imparting of
information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience" alludes to the
concept of "know-how" which is defined to mean "undivulged technical knowledge,
information, experience or technique that is necessary for the industrial reproduction of
a product or process". The licence agreement specifically provided for supply of software
licence only, and the assessee had only supplied a standard, off-the-shelf software to the
Indian company and had not given any "know-how" to the Indian company from which
the Indian company could reproduce it for its perpetual use as the Indian company had
to purchase licences equal to number of cars manufactured by it. The payments received
by the assessee was not for the use of the copyright or imparting information concerning
industrial, commercial or scientific experience and thus would not fall within the scope
of article 12(3) of the DTAA to be taxed as royalty income. The receipts were business
income in the hands of the assessee which was not taxable in India in the absence of
a permanent establishment of the assessee in India. Held that interest under section
234A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 is levied only in cases where the assessee does not
furnish its return of income or furnishes it after the due date prescribed under section
139 of the Act. The facts on record revealed that the assessee filed its return of income
within the prescribed (extended) due date applicable to the assessment year. The
Assessing Officer was to verify the date of filing of the return vis-a-vis the due date of
filing of return for the assessment year 2020-21 in the light of the CBDT Notification
No. 93/2020/F. No. 370142/35/2020-TPL dated December 31, 2020 by which the due date
for furnishing of returns for the assessment year 2020-21 was extended to February 15,
2021 and decide it afresh in accordance with law. Tribunal also held that the proviso
inserted in section 209(1)(d) of the Act by the Finance Act, 2012 with effect from April
1, 2012 would apply only where the person responsible for deducting tax has paid or
credited such income without deduction of tax. Since the income had been received by

The Assessee contended that the overseas company did not carry out any dredging
operations in India but only gave dredgers to the Assessee Company in India on a time
charter basis, for which it charged a fixed fee/remuneration irrespective of the actual
usage of such vessel. The Revenue argued that the foreign company had a business
connection in India as the dredgers were continuously operating in Indian territorial
waters. The Hon'ble Tribunal held that the foreign company did not have a business
connection or permanent establishment in India. That the foreign company only
provided dredgers on a lease basis without engaging in any active business operations
in India. Further that the operational staff and the captain worked under the supervision
and control of the Assessee, and the payments were for the use of equipment, not for
any business activity conducted by the foreign company in India. (AY 2003 to 2010-11)

The Assessee a US-based company, entered into Participating Carrier Distribution
and services agreements with various airlines in India to facilitate ticket booking and
related services through its computer reservation system (CRS). The company also
had subscriber agreements with global travel agencies, allowing them access to the
CRS. The Assessing Officer (AO) and the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) held that the
Assessee had a fixed place PE and agency PE in India based on earlier assessment years'
findings, despite changes in the business model post-2005. The Assessee contended
that after 2005, there was a significant change in its business model. The company no
longer provided computers, printers, or communication lines to travel agents in India.
Instead, global travel agencies independently sourced these requirements. The Assessee
argued that it did not have any office or employees in India and was not responsible
for providing any equipment to Indian travel agents, thus negating the existence of a
fixed place PE or agency PE in India. The Revenue contended that the Assessee had a
fixed place PE and agency PE in India based on the company's operations and income
generated from India. The AO and DRP relied on earlier assessment years' findings,
arguing that the CRS gateway used by travel agents constituted a fixed place of business
in India. They also maintained that the business model changes post-2005 did not
materially alter the company's operations in India.

Income deemed to accrue or arise in India. S. 9(1)(1)
The Hon'ble Tribunal ruled in favor of the Assessee holding that the company did not have a fixed place PE or agency PE in India post-2005 due to changes in its business model. The Hon'ble Tribunal noted that the Assessee no longer provided equipment or communication links to Indian travel agents and had no office or employees in India. That the burden of proving the existence of a PE lies with the Revenue, which failed to establish this in light of the changed business model. (AY. 2012-13 to 2016-17)

Assessee, a Mauritius based company, was engaged in telecasting sports channel called
'Ten Sports'. It appointed its Indian subsidiary (Taj India) as its advertising sales agent to
sell commercial advertisement time to prospective advertisers in India. It also appointed
Taj India as its distributor to distribute subscription supported television programming
service solely for exhibition to subscribers in India. Later, by addendum in distribution
agreement assessee gave Taj India authority to conclude contracts in its name. Assessing
Officer held that assessee had a dependent agent PE in India within meaning of article
5(4)(i) of DTAA on ground that Taj India had authority to conclude contracts in name
of assessee hence the income is taxable in India. On appeal the CIT(A) held that the
assessee did not have any PE with respect to its distribution functions. On cross appeal
the Tribunal held that since Assessing Officer failed to establish that Taj India habitually
exercised authority to conclude contracts on behalf of assessee, in such case Taj India
could not be said to be dependent agent PE of assessee under article 5(4) of DTAA and
distribution income of assessee was not be taxable in India. (AY. 2013-14)

of equipment and supervision, installation, erection and commissioning activity.
Assessee did was not involved in any installation activity. Installation, erection and
commissioning of projects was handled by wholly owned subsidiary of Germany
company-Assessing Officer was of view that turnkey contract was a single composite
contract between assessee and clients in India, thus he made an addition towards
income attributable to Indian PE from said contracts and taxed same in hands of
assessee-Whether in view of decision of Tribunal in assessee's own case for subsequent
assessment years, contracts entered into by assessee with Indian clients was single
composite contract and income arising therefrom was to be assessed in hands of the
assessee, because project office of assessee constituted a PE in India. Further since
assessee had failed to provide necessary information to justify that there was an error
in computation of profit attribution to PE in India and there was duplication of income

The assessee, a tax resident of Thailand, which is engaged in the business of
manufacturing of train control and signalling systems for mass transit system. In terms
with the contract, the assessee made offshore supply of goods and equipments to DMRC
from outside India and received certain amount of consideration for such supply. The
Assessing Officer held that the assessee had a service PE in India, through which,
it executed the contract. Accordingly, out of the receipts from offshore supplies, the
Assessing Officer attributed 10 per cent of the total receipts as profits of the PE and
accordingly, brought the same to tax same. The DRP upheld the view taken by the
Assessing Officer. On appeal the Tribunal held that, that the assessee did not have any
place of business in India and all business activities with respect to offshore supplies
were carried outside India. Equipment supply had been manufactured at overseas
manufacturing facility of assessee and sale of equipment had occurred outside India and
payment had also been received by assessee outside India. Therefore, addition made by
Assessing Officer was deleted. (AY. 2020-21)

Assessee is an Engineer (Under Water Inspector) working at offshore fields. During
year under consideration, it he had received salary income from his Singapore based
employer for work done in oil fields in Bay of Bengal in international water and had
claimed same as exempt income. Assessing Officer held that oil fields in Bay of Bengal
was part of Indian Territory and therefore, work performed by assessee could not be
termed as work outside Indian Territory and also held that co-ordinates of oil fields
in Bay of Bengal were situated within Exclusive Economic Zone of India and same
was within part of "India" as defined in section 2(25A). Accordingly, he had made
an addition of same under section 5(2)(b) read with section 9(1)(ii). CIT(A) affirmed
the order of the AO. On appeal the Tribunal held that sub-section 9 of section 7 of
Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime
Zones Act, 1976 gave freedom of navigation to foreign ships and therefore employees
working on such ships who were not carrying out activities as specified by said
notification were not deemed to be working in India. On facts, salary income received
by assessee from his foreign employer was exempt income because of his non-residential
status as salary was earned for working in international waters. Addition is deleted. (AY.

The salary and the compensatory allowances were paid to the Assessee at Vienna
from the company in India which were permissible to be utilized through a credit

Assessee-company made interest payment to China Development Bank (CDB) without
deducting tax at source under section 195 claiming benefit of article 11. AO held that
since as per Financial Statement of CDB only 36. 45% shares in said Bank was held

claim benefit of DTAA and, hence, assessee was liable to deduct tax under section 195.

of China and is eligible for the beneficial provisions of Article 11(3) of the India-China
DTAA. On appeal the Tribunal held that in protocol to India-China DTAA, paragraph
3 was simultaneously inserted by deleting erstwhile paragraph 3 which defined term
'any financial institution wholly owned by Government of other Contracting State' and
specific institutions listed in protocol for both India and China, were always covered as
Government owned financial institution for purpose of article 11. Therefore CDB being
a financial institution wholly owned by Government of China was eligible for benefit
of provisions of Article 11(3) the assessee could not be treated as assessee in default
with respect to non-deduction of tax on interest payments made to CDB. (AY. 2016-17)

S. 9(1)(v) : Income deemed to accrue or arise in India-Interest-Right to receive interest
income on compulsorily convertible debentures (CCDs)-Taxed @10 per cent as per
Article 11 of India-Cyprus DTAA-DTAA-India-Cyprus. [Art. 11(2)]

Assessee is a Cyprus based company and was a wholly owned subsidiary of a company
based in Mauritius. It invested in compulsorily convertible debentures (CCDs) of an
Indian company and earned interest. Assessee claimed benefit of tax rate of 10 per cent
as per India-Cyprus DTAA. Assessing Officer denied benefit of said rate on ground that
Mauritius based company was beneficial owner of interest income and not assessee and
taxed same at domestic rate of 40 per cent. Held that investment in CCDs was done by
assessee in its own name through proper banking channels and assessee had complete
right to receive and enjoy interest income earned on CCDs without any obligation to
pass on same to any other person. Assessee had also got complete control over interest
income on investment in CCDs and was free to enjoy same as per its own wish. On
facts, assessee being beneficial owner of interest income on CCDs from Indian entity,
was entitled for taxability at a concessional rate as provided under article 11(2). (AY.

Resident telecommunication operators for provision of bandwidth and inter-

definition of royalty inserted later-Assessee cannot be expected to foresee future

Section 201 of the Act-DTAA-India-Belgium-SLP of Revenue is dismissed on account of
delay of 222 days and also on merits. [S. 195, Art. 136]
High Court held that a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement being a sovereign document
between two countries the assessee was entitled to take the benefit thereunder. Therefore,
the Tribunal's view that the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement cannot be considered
in proceedings under section 201 was untenable. Held that amendment to the provisions
of section 9(1)(vi) inserting the Explanations would not result in amendment of the
Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements. The Supreme Court had held that Explanation
4 to section 9(1)(vi) was not clarificatory of the position as on June 1, 1976 and had
expanded that position to include what was stated therein by the Finance Act, 2012.
Explanations 5 and 6 to section 9(1)(vi) had been inserted with effect from June 1, 1976.
Held that the fact that for the subsequent years in the assessee's own case, the Tribunal
had held that tax was not deductible under section 195 when payment was made to non-
resident telecommunications operators was not refuted. Therefore, the payments made to
non-resident telecommunications operators for providing inter-connectivity services and
transfer of capacity in foreign countries was not chargeable to tax as royalty under section
9(1)(vi). Held that the Department had no jurisdiction to bring to tax income that arose
from extra-territorial sources. The non-resident telecommunications operators to whom
the assessee had made payments had no presence in India. The assessee's contract was
with B, a Belgium entity which had made certain arrangement with OMT for utilisation of
bandwidth and B had permitted the assessee to utilise a portion of the bandwidth which
it had acquired from OMT. The facilities were situated outside India and the agreement
was with B, a foreign entity which did not have any permanent establishment in India.
Therefore, the assessee was not liable to deduct tax at source under section 195 on the

payments made to the non-resident telecommunications operators. Held that Deputy
Director (International Transaction) was not right in holding that for the assessment years
2013-14 to 2015-16 the withholding of tax liability could be levied at a higher rate at
20 per cent. Held that as a deductor, the assessee was not liable for deduction of tax at
source for payments made for the assessment years 2008-09 to 2012-13 on the basis of a
subsequent amendment to section 9(1)(vi) whereby Explanations 5 and 6 were introduced.

Consideration received on basis of agreements from telecommunication operators

taxation avoidance agreement override statutory provisions and amendments thereto-

agreements for provision of bandwidth not royalty-Use or right to use-DTAA-India-
Singapore. [S. 90(2),260A, Art. 3(2), 12(3)]
Dismissing the appeal of the Revenue, Court held that consideration received on basis
of agreements from telecommunication operators for Bandwidth and inter-connectivity
usage of their customers. Provisions of double taxation avoidance agreement override
statutory provisions and amendments thereto. Receipts not assessable as royalty in
India. No alienation of copyrighted articles, patents, trademarks, designs, models, secret
formulae or processes, property or information. Mere advantage or benefit derived from
service provided cannot be countenanced to fall within meaning of expressions use or
right to use. Receipts under agreements for provision of bandwidth not royalty. That
even if Explanations 2 and 6 to section 9 applied, the position would remain unaltered
since there was no transfer or conferment of a right in respect of a patent, invention or
process. Customers and those availing of the services provided by the assessee were not
accorded a right over the technology possessed or infrastructure by it. The underlying
technology and infrastructure remained under the direct and exclusive control of
the assessee and the parties availing of the assessee's services were not provided a
corresponding general or effective control over any intellectual property or equipment.
The agreements merely enabled them to avail of the services offered by the assessee. A
person who was provided mobile communication services or access to the internet did
not stand vested with a right over a patent, invention or process. The consideration that
the service recipient paid also could not be recognised as being intended to acquire a
right in respect of a patent, invention, process or equipment. The word "process" being
liable to be construed ejusdem generis was lent added credence by clause (iii) employing
the expression "or similar property" which followed. It was intended to extend to a host
of intellectual properties. Neither the concept of process nor equipment royalty were
attracted and the considerations for the transactions in question were not taxable under
article 12 of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. (AY. 2011-12, 2012-13, 2014-15

same service for country code top-level domains, which includes a mark, distinguishes
the goods and services of one person from those of others. Agreement in no uncertain
terms, establishes that the assessee has given up exclusive ownership or use of data
elements for all registered names submitted by it to the registry database or sponsored
by it. Agreement clearly establishes that the assessee who acts as a registrar and, in
that capacity, provides domain registration services to its customers does not have
any proprietorship rights in the domain name. Therefore, the submission advanced
on behalf of the assessee, i. e., that since it is not the domain name's owner, it cannot
confer the right to use or transfer the right to use the domain name to another person/
entity, is accepted ance. Therefore, the fee received by the assessee for registration of
domain names of third parties, i. e., its customers, cannot be treated as royalty. Appeal
of assessee is allowed. (AY. 2013-14 to 2015-16)

Copyright and right to copyrighted article-Customer relationship management services

Singapore [Art. 12(4)(b)]
Dismissing the appeal of the Revenue the Court held that since the copyright in the
application was never transferred nor vested in a subscriber, the fees were not assessable
under section 9 of the Act. Court also held that article 12(4)(b) of the Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreement between Singapore and India would have been applicable provided the
Department had been able to establish that the assessee had provided technical knowledge,
experience, skill, know-how or processes enabling the subscriber acquiring the services to
apply the technology contained therein. The explanation of the assessee, which had not been
refuted even before the High Court was that the customer was merely accorded access to
the application and it was the subscriber which thereafter inputs the requisite data and took
advantage of the analytical attributes of the software. This would clearly not fall within the
ambit of article 12(4)(b) of the Agreement. (AY. 2011-12 to 2017-18)

appeal the Tribunal held that since assessee sold compiled, indexed or curated articles
obtained from other authors as copyrighted article/product, for easy access to customers
and limited rights to access online journals granted by assessee to Indian customers did
not amount to granting of any right in copyright in any manner whatsoever, receipts

from Indian customers for offshore sales of books/journals or providing access to online
journals/online library did not qualify as royalties under Act as well as under Treaty.

Assessee, a Singapore based company, had entered into franchise agreement with
Indian companies to sub-license brand names to third party hotels in India. Assessee
offered amounts received towards franchise, license fee etc. as royalty income. However,
assessee did not offer receipts from reservation services, marketing services and loyalty
programme to tax in India pleading that they were neither in nature of royalty nor fees
for technical services. Assessing Officer held that amount received for services rendered
in connection with use or right to use any trade mark fell within scope of royalty and,
thus, treated said receipts as royalty/fee for technical services under section 9 and under
article 12 of India-Singapore DTAA. DRP affirmed the order of the AO. On appeal the
Tribunal held that since in assessee's own case for earlier assessment year 2015-16, on
similar facts, it was held that there was no transfer of use or right to use any industrial
or commercial or scientific equipments and, thus, amount in dispute would not qualify
as royalty. Addition was deleted. (AY. 2020-21, 2021-22)

a business loss. VOIPL a subsidiary of assessee in India, had entered into a service
agreement with assessee to avail ongoing assistance and support in field of information
technology, operations, quality, health & safety estimating and engineering, marketing,
administration, personnel, etc.. For rendering above services, assessee had recovered a
certain sum from VOIPL, without any mark-up. Assessing Officer had considered said
payments to be for use of information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific
experience in India and had, accordingly, held same to be taxable as royalty in India.
DRP approved the draft assessment order. On appeal the Tribunal held that since for
rendering of these services, there was no element of imparting of any know-how or
transfer of any knowledge, skill or experience, none of services provided by assessee in
terms of 'service agreement' fell within scope and ambit of 'royalty' as defined in article
12(4). Since management services fees charged was on allocation of cost which was
without mark-up, same being in nature of reimbursements did not constitute royalty as

trademarks and hence such payments were taxable in India as royalty as per provisions
of article 13 of India-UK DTAA and article 12 of India-Swiss Confederation DTAA.
CIT(A) up held the order of the AO. On appeal the Tribunal held that the assessee had
not offered explanation regarding basis for raising invoice on assessee and also on
what basis discount was offered to assessee by overseas educational institutions even
after affording several opportunities to assessee both during course of assessment as
well as appellate proceedings. Tribunal held that unless and until nature and basis
of raising invoices by overseas educational institutions was clear to tax authorities, it
was not possible to come to conclusion that no payments were made for use of trade
name/brand of national educational institutions and payment was only for authorizing
assessee to act as a mediator between students and educational institutions outside of
India. Accordingly the matter is remanded to Assessing Officer to understand basis on
which lump sum fee was charged by overseas entities from assessee and also basis for
allowing/affording discount to assessee. (AY. 2017-18, 2018-19)

Income. CIT(A) affirmed the order of the Assessing Officer. On appeal the Tribunal held
that the assessee could not be prevented from raising a claim that receipts from sale
of software were not chargeable to Indian Taxation merely because such income was
wrongly offered in ROI and which was not revised. However, since nature and character
of sale proceeds qua underlying evidences did not appear to have been verified by
Assessing Officer at any stage of proceedings, matter was to be remitted back to file of

it filed return of income by treating subscription fee received for providing access to
data base as business income, not taxable in India as per provisions of India-US DTAA.
Assessing Officer, treated receipt of assessee as FIS on ground that same was in nature
of technical consultancy. Tribunal held that subscription fee received by assessee was
in nature of business profit which could not be brought to tax in India in absence of
Permanent Establishment (PE). On appeal the Court held that access to data base did not
constitute rendering of any technical or consultancy services and in any case did not
amount to technical knowledge, experience, skill, know-how or processes being made
available to subscriber neither there was any transfer of copyright. Order of Tribunal is
affirmed. (AY. 2018-19, 2019-20)

No substantial question of law. [S. 195, 201(1), 201(IA), 260A]
Assessee is an Indian software development company. Assessee sub-contracted its onsite
overseas work to its subsidiary in China and made payment of sub-contracting charges
to said subsidiary. Assessing Officer held that payments made to subsidiary in China
was liable for tax deduction under section 9(1)(vii) as fees for technical services (FTS)
in view of retrospective amendment to section 9 by Finance Act, 2010 and substitution
of Explanation to said section. High court held that substitution had taken place in
Finance Act, 2010 which was effective from 2011-12, thus, same would not apply to
assessee during relevant years. Accordingly the assessee is not liable to deduct tax at
source on payments made by it to its subsidiary in China. No substantial question of
law. (AY. 2009-10, 2010-11)

The Assessing Officer held that payments made by BCCI to IMG (UK) for designing
and managing the IPL were taxable in India as fees for technical services (FTS) under
section 9(1)(vii) and Article 13 of the India-UK DTAA. The Tribunal partly upheld
this view, holding that the income was divisible: services attributable to IMG's Indian
service PE were taxable in India as business income under Article 7, whereas income
attributable to IMG's UK office was not taxable in India. On appeal Court held that the

services performed by IMG UK did not satisfy the "make available" test under Article
13(4)(c) since no technical knowledge, skill or know-how was transferred to BCCI. The
Court emphasised that mere furnishing of advice, reports or research material does not
constitute transfer of expertise enabling the recipient to act independently in future. It
further held that services connected with IPL seasons shifted to South Africa and UAE
were utilised outside India and income therefrom arose from sources outside India,
hence not taxable under section 9(1)(vii)(b). However, the income attributable to the
Indian service PE remained taxable as business income under Article 7. (AY. 2010-11

that the assessee provides technical services, that too, through human intervention. Even
assuming for argument's sake that the services provided by the assessee are of technical
nature, that by itself would not be enough to bring such receipts within the purview of

Held that no material or evidence had been brought on record by the Revenue to
substantiate its claim that the assessee rendered any managerial, consultancy or
technical services to the Indian associated enterprises through the expatriates in
furtherance of its business in India. The payment made by the Indian associated
enterprises was purely reimbursement of the expatriates' salary costs, which the assessee
had cross-charged by raising debit notes on the Indian associated enterprises. It could
not be regarded as "fees for technical services" in the hands of the assessee as it was
taxable as salary in the hands of the expatriate employees, who worked under the direct
control and supervision of the Indian associated enterprises, and during the entire
period of secondment, the associated enterprise were the real and economic employer
of these expatriates. The expatriates had offered the entire salary income to tax in
their respective returns of income as supported by form 16. As a result, the receipts
were in the nature of employees' salary reimbursement cost, not having any element of
income and not taxable in India as fees for technical services under the Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreement between India and Japan. Consequently, the addition made on
account of assessee's cross-charge raised on its Indian associated enterprises is deleted.

no connection with the services rendered under the technical collaboration agreement.
While the services rendered under the service agreement were for day-to-day office
functioning and maintenance of the information technology infrastructure, the services
rendered under the technical collaboration agreement were purely and strictly in
connection with the drip irrigation system required for agricultural purposes. Therefore,
the services rendered under the services agreement could not be considered ancillary
and subsidiary to the services rendered under technical collaboration agreement. Further,

Assessee is engaged in business of logistics and freight forwarding across globe. During
relevant assessment year, assessee earned network fees from its Indian associate
enterprise (AE). Assessee did not offer said fees to tax on ground that it did not have
any permanent establishment (PE) in India and network fees were business income.
Assessing Officer held that network fees were in nature of fees for technical services
(FTS) as per explanation 2 to section 9(1)(vii) and is taxable in India. DRP affirmed the
order of the AO. On appeal the Tribunal held that Tribunal in assessee's own case for
earlier assessment years had held that nothing was brought on record to substantiate
that any technical know how was made available to Indian AE and thus, network fees
received by assessee from its Indian is deleted. (AY. 2021-22)

Assessee paid software licensing fee to a US company. Assessing Officer held that
payment is in nature of fee for included services as per article 12(4)(b) of India-US

held that only commercial information was transferred to end user and not technical
knowledge as required under article 12(4)(b) to constitute fee for included services,
said payment could not be taxed as fee for included services. Tribunal also held that
installation and integration services provided by assessee to US company were merely
support services dealing with installation and integration and when primary services
themselves were not taxable as FTS, these ancillary services qua primary services could
not be taxed as FTS. (AY. 2021-22)

local sales orders in US for its AE for products to be manufactured, executed by
SEPL India, and received payment from customers which was remitted to SEPL India.
Assessee received certain sum as commission on sales and marketing services. Assessing
Officer held that payments received by assessee from SEPL India were in nature of
FTS under section 9(1)(vii) and was chargeable to tax in India under article 12 with

function with connecting potential customers from US by performing pre sales activity
of introducing SEPL India to potential customers and rest of activity was predominantly
taken care by SEPL India. The assessee did not render services resulting in provision of

section 9(1)(vii). (AY. 2013-14, 2014-15)

Held that the fact that provision of services may require technical input by the person
providing the service did not mean that technical knowledge, skills, etc., were "made
available" to the person purchasing the service. Therefore, payment made by the
assessee to the non-resident service provider could not be brought under article 12 of
the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. (AY. 2010-11, 2012-13, 2013-14, 2016-17,

is not taxable as business income-DTAA-India-USA,[S. 9(1)(i), 9(1)(vii),, Art. 7, 12(4)]
Held, dismissing the appeal of the Revenue the Tribunal held that the included services
were ancillary or auxiliary in nature and being an integral part of the job undertaken by
the assessee, they were neither independent of, nor separable from, the job undertaken
by the assessee in relation to publicity, advertisement and sales promotion of the
hotel business worldwide, which were the main services rendered by the assessee to
the Indian company, keeping the use of trademark, trade name and other enumerated
services incidental to the main service, and that, thus, the payments received were
neither in the nature of royalty under section lon 9(1)(vi), Explanation 2 nor in the nature
of fees for technical services under section 9(1)(vii), Explanation 2 but in the nature of
business income not taxable in India owing to the absence of a permanent establishment
for the assessee in India. Order of CIT(A)) is affirmed. (AY. 2021-22)

Held that the designs and drawings were made outside India in Switzerland and were
supplied to the contractee from Switzerland and the sale transaction was completed

S. 9(1)(vii)
Income deemed to accrue or arise in India

in Switzerland and amounts were received in Switzerland. From the details of designs
and drawings as well as documentation submission, schedule of drawings and designs,
it was clear that the drawings and designs supplied by the assessee were specifically
related to the supply of plant and equipment for the JSW steel project. Though both the
contracts, one for supply of plant and equipment and the other for supply of drawings
and designs had been separately executed, they had been executed on the very same
date. The purchaser was vested with the right to terminate the contract unilaterally,
inter alia, due to the delay in delivery of the equipment in excess of 120 days for the
reasons solely attributable to the seller and if the seller failed to take necessary remedial
action. Thus, failure to supply plant and equipment within the stipulated time period
could determine the contract for supply of drawing and design and the purchaser could
terminate the contract in that eventuality. Therefore, the contract for supply of drawings
and designs was inextricably linked to the contract for supply of plant and equipment.
When the supply of plant and equipment had been treated as sale transaction completed
outside India, and hence, not taxable in India, the sale and supply of drawings and
designs being inextricably linked to sale and supply of plant and equipment had to
be considered cumulatively and as a part of sale and supply of plant and equipment.
Therefore, the amount received by the assessee from supply of drawings and designs
was not taxable in India as fees for technical services. Tribunal also held that the
assessee had entered into a contract for supply of electromagnetic stirrer. According to
the assessee's admission, technical personnel were deputed to supervise the erection and
commissioning of the plant and equipment. Thus, in course of such supervisory activity,
the qualified technical personnel deputed by the assessee must have imparted technical
services for erection and commissioning of the plant and equipment. Therefore, the
amount received fell within the definition of fees for technical services, both under the
domestic law as well as under article 12(4) of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement
and it was immaterial whether the assessee had a permanent establishment in India or
not. Therefore, the amount having qualified as fees for technical services, had rightly
been brought to tax in the hands of the assessee. (AY. 2008-09)

at source-Article 12 of OECD Model Convention-Levy of interest is not barred by

The Assessee, an Association of Persons (AOP) engaged in providing technical expertise
in oil exploration and refinery, made payments to its member companies for the salary
expenses and other benefits of seconded employees without deducting TDS. The
Assessing Officer held that the reimbursements constituted fees for technical services
as per Explanation 2 to section 9(1)(vii), making TDS deductible under section 194J
for resident secondees and section 195 for non-resident secondees and payments to
foreign agents. CIT(A) deleted the disallowance. On appeal the Tribunal held that,
reimbursements for Indian salary and other benefits to member companies were not
fees for technical services within the meaning of Explanation 2 to section 9(1)(vii),

56


--- Page 57 ---
Income deemed to accrue or arise in India. S. 9(1)(vii)
hence TDS was not deductible. Payments made to resident secondees did not require
TDS under section 194J as there was no employer-employee relationship between
the Assessee and the secondees. Payments made to non-resident secondees were not
chargeable to tax under section 5(2)(b) as the services were rendered outside India, thus
no TDS was required under section 195. Payments to foreign agents did not attract TDS
under section 195 as there was no business connection in India, and the agents did
not perform any operations in India. The Tribunal also held that levy of interest is not
barred by limitation. (AY. 1996-97 to 1998-1999)

Marketing contribution, priority club receipt and reservation contribution with Indian
hotels for using trade marks and providing support programs and systems-Fees
received from Indian Hotels is not royalty-Addition is deleted-DTAA-USA. [Art. 12(3)]
The assessee, a tax resident of USA, had entered into licence agreements with various
Indian hotels allowing them the use of trademarks 'Holiday Inn' and 'Crowne Plaza'
in the business. The Royalty income earned was offered to tax in India. However,
the marketing contribution and reservation fees received by the assessee from hotels
in India were claimed as not taxable on the basis that the same is in the nature of
reimbursement of common expenses. However, while completing the assessment u/s
143(3) rws 144C (3), the AO held it to be part of Royalty and added the same as income
of the assessee. The CIT (A) upheld the addition. On further appeal, it was pleaded that
the money received on account of marketing contribution and reservation fees were
with a corresponding obligation to use it for the agreed purposes. The fund so created
was obligated to expend assessment proceeds on behalf of the hotels and the fund's
objective is to be self-funded each year. The report of independent auditor was filed
in support thereof. Taking into account orders of the coordinate benches in the case of
other assessee as well as assessee's own case for other assessment years, the Tribunal
held that the marketing contribution and reservation fees received by the assessee was
not royalty and therefore, the impugned addition was deleted. (AY. 2012-13, 2013-14,

The assessee is engaged in providing worldwide Marketing and advertising services to

in India. Assessee claimed refund of TDS deducted by Indian hotels and claimed income

Human resource screening services for clients in India-Reports provided to clients
about candidates proposed to be hired not copyrightable but bound by confidentiality-
Receipts is neither taxable as royalty nor as fees for technical services-DTAA-India-
United Kingdom. [S. 9(1)(vi), Art. 7, 13(4), Copyright Act, 1957 13(1), 14(a)]
Held that the role of the assessee was restricted to verification of the information
concerning various candidates proposed to be hired by its clients. The information
collected by the assessee was not protected by any copyright, but its circulation was
regulated under the U. K., and other local laws, which cast a duty upon it to ensure
the confidentiality of the reports as they contained details of the applicants. None of
the requisites under article 13(3) of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement was
satisfied so as to qualify such receipts as "royalty". The assessee was merely providing
a report summarising its findings with respect to the background check undertaken by
it, which report constituted factual data and could not per se qualify as literary, artistic
or scientific work, patent, trademark, design, model, plan, secret formula or process
or information. It did not fulfil the requirements enlisted under section 13(1)(a) of the
Copyright Act, 1957. Moreover, none of the rights mentioned in section 14(a) thereof
had been vested with the client by the assessee. The client did not have any right to
publicly display, sell, distribute, copy, edit, modify or commercially exploit the report.
The consideration received by the assessee was purely towards provision of background
screening services and not for use, or right to use, any copyrightable material. Further,
the assessee did not provide access to any database to its clients but only access to
reports requisitioned by the client, in electronic form. Nothing had been brought on
record by the Revenue to refute the assessee's claim. Online access to background
screening results was not tantamount to providing access to the database maintained
by the assessee. That the information obtained by the assessee from various sources
was in the nature of factual data about prospective candidates, which did not involve
imparting any kind of commercial experience, skill or expertise. It was a validation
report assuring its client about the authenticity of the information contained therein.
It did not involve any transfer of either commercial experience or the right to use the
experience, nor transfer of any skill or knowledge of the assessee to the customers. As
the assessee's services did not involve any technical skill, knowledge or consultancy
or make available any technical knowledge, experience, skill, know-how or processes
to the clients, the services should not be considered fees for technical services under
article 13(4) of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. No addition could be made
on account of royalty(AY. 2021-22)

Assessee, a Hong Kong based company, which is engaged in business of distribution
of telecommunication products. During relevant assessment years, assessee received
reimbursement of connectivity charges from its AE, Indian subsidiary for provision
of connectivity services for international communication. Assessing Officer held that
the assessee provided plethora of services to its AE right from negotiating agreements
with third parties entering into purchase agreement, to issuing inspection certificates
certifying products and services-He, thus held that these services would fall within
ambit of 'technical consultancy' or managerial services and would qualify as fees for
technical services under section 9(1)(vii). DRP affirmed the order of the AO. On appeal
the Tribunal held that from purchasing service agreement between assessee and AE that
all activities agreed to in writing by and between company and service provider were
considered as steps involved in processing product purchased as per purchasing service
agreement and could not be treated as other technical services. Since assessee was
only paid for connectivity services which were merely ancillary to enabling provision
of inter-connect services and part of processing product, same could not be treated as
technical or managerial or consultancy services. Amount received by assessee could not
be regarded as FTS under section 9(1)(vii) of the Act. (AY. 2018-19, 2019-20)

certain amount from its Indian customer and claimed said income to be not taxable in

the addition. On appeal the Tribunal held that very same issue in assessee's own case
was decided in favour of assessee by Tribunal for earlier assessment years 2017-18 to
2019-20 holding that article 12(4)(b) stipulates taxability of income arising therefrom
only if services concerned make available technical knowledge to recipient/payer. Since
condition of make available had not been satisfied, services would not be taxable in

Assessee, a tax resident of Mauritius, which is engaged in business of managing
diamond factories and facilitating diamantaires to operate economically for high quality
diamond factories across the Globe. It had entered into a technical collaboration with
its Associated Enterprises [AEs) in India viz., for providing technical, process, marketing
and sales assistance services outside India and received fees for technical services
(FTSs). Assessing Officer invoking provisions of section 9(1)(vii) read with section
115A(1)(b) and held that FTS were chargeable to tax in India. CIT(A) up held the order
of the AO. On appeal the Tribunal held that there was no specific clause in DTAA
entered into between India and Mauritius and article 12A was inserted with effect from
1-4-2017 which could not be applied for financial year 2017-18. It is a settled position
of law by various co-ordinate benches and High Courts that in absence of a clause
in DTAA not dealing with a particular item of income, payments are not be regarded
as residuary income but as business income which is not chargeable to tax in India,
in absence of any PE of non-resident assessee in India. Accordingly the FTS income
received by assessee would not be taxable in India. (AY. 2017-18)

account of subscription payments, training and professional fees. Assessing Officer
held that said receipts were taxable as fee for technical services under article 12 of
India-Netherlands DTAA. DRP up held the order of the Assessing Officer. On appeal
the Tribunal held that since assessee had merely granted only access to software and
there was no transfer of technology by assessee, services rendered by assessee did not
fall within definition of FTS. (AY. 2020-21, 2011-22)

S. 10(1): Agricultural income-Soil placed on trays-Agricultural activity-Mushroom
is an agricultural product-Income from sale of mushrooms constitutes agricultural
income. [S. 2(IA)] 158
Held that soil is a part of land and, therefore, part of earth. The only part of the land
that is cultivable is the soil, which is the top layer of land. When soil is placed on trays,
it did not cease to be land and operations carried out on that soil would be agricultural
activity. Whether such soil was attached to the land or placed in containers above
the land made no difference. Soil which is placed on a vertical space above the land
in trays is also land. That the word product could not be restricted to plants, fruits,
vegetables or such botanical life only. The only condition was that the product should

be raised on the land by performing some basic operations. Mushroom is a product
raised on land or soil by performing certain basic operation. It drew nourishment
from the soil and was grown by human skill and labour. The product had utility for
consumption, trade and commerce and, hence, would qualify as an agricultural product
the sale of which gave rise to agricultural income. (AY. 2020-21)

Assessee is a director of a seed company and graduate in agricultural science, claimed
exemption on agricultural income under section 10(1). Assessing Officer added
agricultural income to taxable income, citing lack of books of account as required under
section 44AA of the Act. CIT(A) affirmed the order of the AO. On appeal the Tribunal
held that requirement to maintain books of account under section 44AA does not
include agriculturist. Since the assessee submitted copies of sales bills for agricultural
produce, even though to related parties and consistently declared agricultural income
over years addition is deleted. (AY. 2015-16)

(Leave)Rules 1972]
Assessee retired from services of State Bank of India and claimed exemption u/
$10(10AA) of the Act. The exemption is denied. The assessee contended that
law discriminating the Central or State services, in case of employees of other
establishments, period of leave was capped at 10 months and maximum amount
exempted from income tax was subject to such limit as Central Government might notify
in Official Gazette, that same being in year 2017 to be Rs. 3 lakhs was discriminatory
and hence be declared ultra vires. On writ the Court held that State has wide discretion
in matter of classification for taxation purposes. Accordingly the differentiation made by
State between employees of Central and State Governments on one hand and employees
of other establishments on other in section 10 (10AA) was neither discriminating nor
violative of article 14 of Constitution. Therefore, a retired employee of State Bank of
India could not claim parity with employees of Central and State Government. Writ
petition is dismissed.

[S. 10A, Electricity Act, 2003, 131, 133 (2)]
Assessees had joined the then Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) in regular
employment. All of them ended up retiring from the re-designated power companies
constituted under the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003. The AO denied the
exemption which is affirmed by the CIT(A). On appeal the Tribunal held that going
by a conjoint reading of s. 131 r/w s. 133 of Electricity Act, 2003, the services of all
officers and employees of the erstwhile MSEB first stood vested in the State Government
of Maharashtra on Reorganization of the Board, followed by the transfer to various
transferee entities engaged in generation, transmission and distribution of power. All
these assessees had been assigned to their respective new employers after getting
protection of their service conditions in the light of S. 133(2). These assessees have also
undergone the very reorganization finally culminating in their respective superannuation.
Not only these assessees have to be held entitled for exemption under S. 10(10A) and

set-up transferee entities. Therefore, these assessees have to be treated as employees of

Assessee claimed exemption under section 10(10D) in respect of sums received on
maturity of life insurance policy. Assessing Officer deemed it taxable under section
28(vi) as part of a Key man Insurance policy. In appeal, assessee argued that policy's
character changed in 2008 when it was assigned from a proprietorship concern to
assessee, justifying exemption under section 10(10D) as an ordinary policy. The Tribunal
held that there was some merit in contention of assessee that if policy was transferred
before its maturity then it would lose its character. Therefore, it had become ordinary
policy, premium received under this policy, would not be subjected to tax in view of
section 10(10D). Therefore, lower authorities were not justified in denying benefit of
exemption to assessee. (AY. 2016-17)

Dismissing the appeal of the Revenue the Court held that since the Assessing Officer in
his order had reached the conclusion that the assessee had claimed exemptions under
section 10(23C)(iiiab) since it was substantially financed by the Government of more
than 20 per cent., and expenditure had been incurred by the assessee towards its aims
and objects in carrying out educational activities alone, the exemptions were rightly
granted. The Tribunal had found that rule 2BBB of the Income-tax Rules, 1962 was not
applicable during the assessment year 2012-13, since it came into force with effect from
December 12, 2014. There was no error in the orders passed by the Tribunal and the
Assessing Officer and, therefore, need not be interfered with. No substantial question

u/s 10(223C)(iiiad) in its return which was denied on ground that Form 10BB was not
filed by the Assessee. The ITAT observed that the Assessee had filed all the documents
along with the return, which showed that the gross receipts of the Assessee was Rs. 2.
50 crores. Before ITAT, the Assessee submitted that it was covered by the judgment of
the jurisdictional High Court in case of CIT v. Children's Education Society [2013] 358
ITR 373 (Kar.) in which it was held that "the exemption in terms of the provisions of s.
10(23C)(iiiad) was available to the Assessee as annual receipts of each of the institutions
of the Assessee was less than the prescribed limit under the provision.". It was held
that the issue is no longer debatable and the AO was directed to give effect to s. 154
application filed by the Assessee. (AY. 2016-17)

S. 10 (23C): Educational institution-Approval by prescribed authority-Object is not
found existed solely for advancing educational purposes-Denial of exemption is
justified. [S. 10(23C)(vi), Art. 226]
Authority has rejected the contention and claim of the assessee-trust on the ground that
as per the aims and objects of the trust, it is apparent that it has not only been formed
for the purpose of advancing education, but is also for other purposes as mentioned
in cl. 5(i), (j), (k), (1), (m), (n) and (o) of the trust deed. On writ, the Court held that
exemption was claimed by the trust itself and not by an individual educational institute
namely, GHG academy, therefore it cannot be conclusively said that the trust was found
and existed solely for advancing education purposes, hence, it was rightly not granted
exemption. (AY. 2012-13)

Since no income from the two entities was shown, the issue of s. 10(23FB) was
academic. The financials of S showed that it qualified as a venture capital undertaking
under the Regulations and therefore, it qualified as a venture capital undertaking for
section 10(23FB). Similarly, in so far as investments made in O shares which were not
listed on a recognised stock exchange which also carried on business activity in India,
nowhere had it been pointed out that these activities were covered in the negative

qualified as a venture capital undertaking under the Regulations. Dividend income is

The Assessing Officer passed an order denying exemption. On appeal CIT(A) directed
the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption. On appeal the Tribunal, affirmed the order
of the Assessing Officer. On appeal the Court held that the approval of the assessee-fund
granted by the competent authority, i.e., the Commissioner by order dated September
29, 1995 continued for the assessment year in question, i.e., the assessment year 2005-
06 and it had neither been withdrawn nor cancelled. Exemption had been denied on
the ground that the assessee-fund did not comply with the conditions of approval and
therefore the fund lost its recognition. The denial of exemption was not valid. Order of

to each other (brothers) and belonged to Khasi tribe which was enlisted as Scheduled
Tribe in State of Meghalaya and was covered under article 366(25) of Constitution of
India. They were residents of Khasi Hills Autonomous District and thus were entitled
to exemption under section 10(26) in their individual capacity. Assessee firm claimed
exemption under section 10(26) on plea that since a partnership firm in itself was not
a separate juridical person and it was only a collective or compendious name for all
of its partners having no independent existence without them, and since partners of
assessee-firm were entitled to exemption under section 10(26), therefore, same exemption

assessable person under Income-tax Act, would not be entitled to same exemption
under section 10(26) as any or all of individual partners would be in their individual
capacity. Advantages and disadvantages conferred under Income-tax Act on separate
class of persons were neither transferable nor inter changeable and, thus, scope of
beneficial provisions could not be extended to a different person under Income-tax Act
as it might defeat mechanism and process provided for assessment of different class/
category of persons. Ratio decidendi in judgment of Gauhati High Court in CIT v. Mahari

Assessee is a trust registered as Venture Capital Fund. Assessee claimed exemption of
long-term capital gains (LTCG) under section 10(38) in respect of sale of unlisted shares
of a company. Assessing Officer held that assessee was not eligible for exemption as it
had not paid Securities Transaction Tax (STT) at time of acquisition of shares. CIT(A)
allowed the exemption. On appeal the Tribunal held that condition prescribed in clause
(a) and (b) of section 10(38) were fulfilled and assessee would be covered by exemption
provided in clause (b)(i) of Notification No. SO 1789(E) dated 5-6-2017. Therefore, even
if assessee did not pay STT at time of acquisition of shares, still it was eligible for
exemption under section 10(38). (AY. 2018-19)

of State Government to support development activities-Entitled to exemption-The order
rejecting exemption under section 10(46) was quashed-The Revenue was directed to
process the application for exemption made by the assessee. [S. 2(15), 10(20A), 119,
Art. 226]
The assessee is an entity constituted under the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area
Development Act, 1976. The Central Board of Direct Taxes rejected its application to
grant exemption under section 10(46) on the ground that the assessee extended loans
to various entities and such activities undertaken were otherwise than for the benefit
of the general public. On a writ petition the Court held that that the assessee had
been constituted under the 1976 Act with the objective of undertaking developmental
activities in an industrial development area. It acted as an arm and an adjunct of the
State charged with undertaking planned development in the industrial development
area. In that connection, the assessee undertook planning and development of the area,
70

S. 10A
acquired land and property, engaged in construction of housing units or industrial units.
In order to fulfil these objectives, it was provided funds by the State Government and
additionally created a corpus from the revenue and receipts generated and received in
the course of its operations. The assessee primarily was an agent of the Government
obligated to undertake planned development of areas placed under its control. It could
not be viewed as being a corporation intended to have been incorporated for a profit or
commercial motive. The provisions of the 1976 Act and the material on record clearly
dispelled any notion of the assessee being a "hardcore trading corporation". Statutory
bodies like the assessee, were intended to act as an "architectural agent" of development
and growth. The Revenue had erred in holding that the loans and advances extended
by the assessee would fall within the ambit of commercial activity. The grant of those
loans had also not been established to have been motivated with a view to profit. Some
of those loans were extended to finance activities supportive and supplemental to the
development activity that was liable to be undertaken by the assessee. The finding in
the order that the assessee had advanced loans to private entities was factually incorrect.
The assessee did not claim exemption of interest income earned from bonds and shares
for the purposes of section 10(46) and the interest income had been ploughed back for
the purposes of carrying out the statutory functions and duties cast upon the assessee.
Although the assessee was called upon to provide all financial details, the Revenue did
not specifically place on notice to answer or tender any explanation with respect to the
amount of interest income that was earned from bonds, shares and fixed deposits. The
order rejecting exemption under section 10(46) was quashed. The Revenue was directed
to process the application for exemption made by the assessee. Relied on Greater Noida

is dismissed. [Art. 136]
Assessee had taken on lease certain area in STPI (Software Technology Park of India).
As assessee could not use entire area for its operation, it sub-leased portion of premises
to two units and was receiving rent for same. It claimed deduction under section 10A.
Assessing Officer disallowed deduction in respect of rental income received from said
two units on ground that lease amounts could not be considered as income derived
from export of any software. Commissioner (Appeals) held that rental income received
by assessee was eligible for inclusion in profit as they were intimately connected with
business of undertakings. Tribunal affirmed the order of the CIT(A). On appeal High
Court held that since conditions such as location of unit in STPI having been complied
with, benefit of section 10A would be available to assessee. Special leave petition filed
against the order of High Court is dismissed. (AY. 2005-06)

terms, the export quantity might be less than 75 per cent of the total sale quantity. [S.
10A(2)(ia), Export-Import Policy 1992-97]
Held that the amendment by introducing sub-s. (ia) to cl. (2) of s. 10A stipulates that
the exports should not be less than 75 per cent of 'the total sales'. The provisions of
the Export Import Policy, 1992-97 provide that 'the entire production of EOU/EPZ units
shall be exported except 25 per cent of the production in value terms may be sold in
the Domestic Tariff Area when the use of indigenous inputs is more than 30 per cent
in value terms'. On the basis of the aforesaid provision, it appears that the section
imposes a value based restriction and not a quantitative restriction. What is required
to be satisfied as per sub-s. (ia) to cl. (2) of s. 10A is that the export turnover should
constitute at least 75 per cent of the total turnover, although in quantitative terms, the
export quantity might be less than 75 per cent of the total sale quantity. (AY. 2000-01)

proper perspective with regard to the assessee's claim that deduction under section 10A
was erroneously made due to the exclusion of foreign currency expenditure from the
export turnover. As the issue needed verification, it was restored to the Assessing Officer
for a decision in terms of the principle laid down by the Tribunal in the assessee's own
case for an earlier assessment year. That the Assessing Officer was directed to verify
whether refund had been issued to the assessee and, if so, the interest charged thereon.

Dispute Resolution Panel in granting the benefit to the assessee that the foreign currency

Explanation was inserted after section 10AA(1) by the Finance Act, 2017, with effect
from the aforesaid date prospectively. On writ, the assessee contested the Explanation
to section 10AA(1) inserted by the Finance Act, 2017 with prospective effect, as
unconstitutional and allegedly violative of articles 14, 19(1)(g), and 265 of the
Constitution of India. Court held that explanation after sub-section (1) of section 10AA,
inserted by amendment with prospective effect from 1-4-2018, applicable in respect of
the assessment year 2018-19 and subsequent years is constitutional and is a valid piece
of legislation and is not arbitrary, discriminatory and is not violative of articles 14, 19

S. 10AA: Special Economic Zones-Qualifying profits-Computation-Gross total income-
Deduction to be allowed from the total income and shall not exceed such total income.
[S. 80AB]
Held, that section 80AB of the Act states that the amount of income computed in
accordance with the provisions of the Act and included in the gross total income is
eligible for deduction. Hence, section 80AB is concerned with the quantum of income
that is eligible for deduction under the heading "C. Deduction in respect of certain
income" in Chapter VI-A. The Explanation inserted in section 10AA of the Act states
that the deduction to be allowed under section 10AA of the Act shall be allowed from
"the total income" and shall not exceed such total income. Hence, the Explanation
specifies "the stage" at which the deduction under section 10AA of the Act should
be allowed (i. e., from the total income) and also states that quantum of deduction
should be restricted to the amount of total income. Accordingly, section 80AB and the
Explanation inserted in section 10AA operate in different fields. The decision of the
Commissioner (Appeals) did not require any interference. (AY. 2017-18, 2018-19)

Assessee has joined as a technician in the central government department of telecom
in the year 1981. The Government of India has corporatized the department of telecom
into BSNL with effect from 1-10-2000. The assessee has credited 280 days of leave
at the time of retirement for the service rendered department of telecom till the date
of corporatization and claimed exemption of 280 days salary. The CPC calculated the
exemption u/s 10(10AA) basing on the present declaration that the assessee was an
employee of BSNL and hence the exemption u/s 10(10AA) was restricted to Rs. 3 lakhs.
Rectification application was rejected. On appeal the Tribunal held that The CIT as well
as the AO has not taken cognizance of these facts and wrongly denied the benefit of
exemption of leave encashment u/s 10(10AA) of the Act. The appeal of the assessee is
allowed. (AY. 2019-20)

Assessee is not entitled to exemption under s. 10B in respect of the amount of export
turnover which was not received within six months from the end of the relevant

received during specified period-Entitled to deduction. [S. 80IC]
Held that in the manufacture of pickles, there was a change in the characteristic of
the raw materials from that of vegetables to a pickle, whose use was also different.
Moreover, section 80-IC(2) talked of manufacture or production and Schedule XIV to
the Income-tax Act, 1961, gave the list of articles or things or operations under item I
recognising fruit and vegetable processing industry manufacturing or producing canned
or bottled products. Obviously, the assessee was a vegetable processing industry and, in
terms of the Schedule, was manufacturing or producing the bottled product of pickles.
There was no reason to hold that the assessee was not engaged in manufacturing
activities. The process of manufacturing pickles from raw vegetables, fruits, masala
and other ingredients brought about a new and different marketable commodity than
the raw material. Entitled to deduction. Held that the assessee had produced bank
realisation certificates, bank certified statement of forex receipts and certificate of the
auditor to show the realisation of export proceeds. There was no infirmity in the order
of the Commissioner (Appeals) in allowing the assessee's claim under section 10B to the
extent of foreign exchange received during the specified period. Both of the assessee's
units had become 100 per cent. export-oriented units. The Commissioner (Appeals)
gave a categorical finding about acquisition of the machinery in different years after
obtaining the remand report. There was no reason to sustain the disallowance made by
the Assessing Officer. (AY. 2001-02 to 2008-09)

Dismissing the appeal of the Revenue the High Court held that the Tribunal had followed
its own decision in which it had granted exemption under section 11 to the assessee for
the assessment years 2008-09 and 2009-10. Since there was nothing on record that such

S. 11: Property held for charitable purposes-Construction activities under State PWD
department-2. 5 per cent supervision charges-Matter is remanded to Assessing Officer
for determination of commercial activity and considering the benefit of section 12A.
[S. 2(15), 12A]
Assessee-society was registered under section 12A with main objective to take up
construction work of any nature to establish a chain of retail outlets. It undertook
construction activities under State PWD department in lieu of 2.5 per cent supervision
charges and accordingly claimed certain amount as applied for charitable purposes.
Assessing Officer held that construction work was an activity of trade, commerce or
business for consideration and assessee could not claim status under section 12A
since activities carried on by it did not fall within the meaning of charitable purpose
warranting exemption from income tax. Order was affirmed by Tribunal. On appeal High
Court held that where assessee executed construction work for benefit of Government
and received certain amount from Government for same, purpose of such construction
work could not be accepted as an activity coming within meaning of advancement of
other object of general public utility. It further held that since assessee was involved
in carrying on of any activity in nature of trade, commerce or business, proviso to
section 2(15) would be attracted and assessee would not be entitled to benefit under
section 11 of the Act. On appeal considering the judgement of Apex Court in ACIT

The assessee-trust had accumulated income under section 11(2) and extended donations
to other charitable trusts. The Assessing Officer held that extending donations to other
charitable trusts would amount to utilization of the funds for a purpose other than those
for which the surplus was accumulated under section 11(2) and thus being violative
of section 11(3)(c) and section 11(3)(d). On appeal, the Commissioner (Appeals) held
in favour of the assessee. On further appeal, the Tribunal affirmed the view taken by
the Commissioner (Appeals). On appeal High Court affirmed the order of the Tribunal.

[S. 11(1)(a), S. 11: Property held for charitable purposes. [S. 11(1)(d), 260A]
Allowing the appeal the Court held that the amounts paid by the parents of the students
admitted to the educational institution of the assessee-trust were payments towards
corpus donation and were not collected by way of capitation fees. The Assessing
Officer had not conducted any inquiry with regard to examination of parents who had
admitted the students in school as to whether the payment was made towards corpus
fund or capitation fee. Though it was true that the donation was bound to have been
given for material gain in securing admission, it could not be characterised as donation
towards charitable purpose and the assessee would not be entitled to have the benefit,
but in the absence of any material on record, such view could not be taken. Therefore,
the Tribunal had committed an error by treating the admission fees charged from the
students as not forming part of the corpus fund of the trust. Therefore, the Tribunal was
not justified in confirming the addition of the corpus fund to the income of the assessee
by holding that the receipts could not be treated as corpus donation and not eligible for
exemption under section 11(1)(d). (AY. 2013-14)

Property held for charitable purposes
S. 11 : Property held for charitable purposes-Specific purposes and objects without
profit motive-Investment in Joint venture and utilisation of land allotted by
Government for commercial purposes and earning profits in form of rental Income
and sharing of profits-Deviation and contravention of objects, purposes and mission-
Not entitled to exemption-Denial of exemption cannot be restricted only to extent of
sum of investment in joint venture-Assessee is not entitled to exemption. [S. 11(5), 12,
12A,13(1)(d), 80G, 260A]
The assessee is a society registered under section 12A of the Act, and was approved
under section 80G of the Act. It was established with a specific purpose, object and
mission to promote the quality of construction and bring in international standards,
and undertook activities for the promotion of education, training, research and
imparting professionalism and skill formation at all levels of construction. For this a
joint venture company H was constituted for holding exhibitions and also to promote
the object and mission of the assessee. For the assessment year 2002-03 the Assessing
Officer held that the investment of the assessee in the joint venture was in violation of
section 11(5) and rejected the claim for exemption under section 11. The Commissioner
(Appeals) and the Tribunal affirmed his order. On appeal dismissing the appeals, (i)
that the assessee-society had acted contrary to its purpose, objects and mission and
could not claim exemption under section 11. There were concurrent findings by the
Commissioner (Appeals) and the Tribunal based on facts available on record that the
assessee had earned profits in contravention of its mission and objects. In addition to
the establishment of a joint venture, the assessee had also parted with hundred acres
of land allotted by the Government to the joint venture which had utilised the land for
purpose of holding exhibitions of all natures and in the process, had earned income
in the form of rent. The joint venture had also used the land for commercial purposes
by allotting the land to other commercial establishments. These aspects had been duly
considered by the Assessing Officer and the appellate authorities who had rejected the
exemption under section 11. The deviation and contravention disentitled the society
from claiming the benefit of exemption under section 11. That the contention of the
assessee that the Tribunal could have restricted the denial of exemption under section
11 to the extent of investment made in the joint venture could not be accepted for the
reason that the amount of investment already carried out by the assessee in the joint
venture, coupled with the fact that the assessee had parted with hundred acres of land
to be used by the joint venture company for gaining rental and other income and the
rental income earned by the joint venture having been shared with the assessee to some
extent, in contravention of the object, purpose and mission for which the assessee was
established. That the Government instructions or Government orders on the basis of
which the assessee had received funds were no longer in existence but were struck
down by the court. In view of passing of G. O. Ms. No. 92, dated May 19, 1998, by
the State Government, the corpus amount generated by the assessee was not voluntary
contribution and therefore, the amount invested by the assessee in the joint venture
company could not be treated as group corpus fund. The amount of investment in
shares of the joint venture company and the transfer of hundred acres of land by the
assessee to the joint venture company were covered under section 13(1)(d). Therefore,
the assessee-society rendered itself disentitled to the benefit under section 11 in view

Dismissing the appeal of the Revenue the Court held that the Tribunal had followed
its own decision in which it had granted exemption under section 11 to the assessee
for the assessment years 2008-09 and 2009-10. Since there was nothing on record that
such orders had been set aside or overruled in any manner by the court, the Tribunal
had found no reason to interfere with the order of the Commissioner (Appeals). There
was no infirmity in the order of the Tribunal granting exemption under section 11 to

Capital asset is held to be wholly for the purpose of charitable purpose-Legal
possession-Sale proceeds were invested with nationalised bank-Entitled to claim
exemption-Order of Tribunal is affirmed-No substantial question of law. [S. 11(IA),
260A]
Assessee, a public charitable trust, entered into an agreement in 1994 with a builder,
Buildforce to sell a property and as per MOU, symbolic possession was given to
Buildforce. Certain dispute arose between Buildforce and assessee and a suit came to
be filed which was settled and under which assessee agreed to accept a certain sum
in full and final settlement and transfer property in favour of nominee of Buildforce
and sale proceeds were invested with nationalised bank and assessee claimed that no
capital gain was to be assessed in hands of assessee in view of provisions of section
11(1A). Assessing Officer did not accept this stand of assessee because, according to
him, assessee entered into an agreement with Buildforce in 1994 and sale deed was
executed in favour of its nominee after a period of almost 12 years and since in this
intervening period of 12 years, possession of property was with Buildforce as per MOU,
assessee was not in possession, it could not be held that property was being held under
trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes and, thus, assessee had not fulfilled
requirement of section 11(1A). CIT(A) allowed the claim. Tribunal affirmed the order of
the CIT(A). On appeal the Court held that once legal possession had been handed over
by assessee only in 2008-09 then it was to be presumed and accepted that said capital
asset was held by assessee trust wholly for charitable purposes till date of its sale and
thus, assessee was entitled to claim benefit under section 11(1A). (AY. 2008-09).

during reassessment proceedings. [S. 11(2) 12A,143(1), 147, 148, Form No. 10, Rule 17]
Held that there is no doubt about the fact that a revised Form No. 10 was filed after
the notice under section 148 was issued, albeit, along with the ROI, in response to
the said notice. Therefore, the point of inflection between the respondent/assessee and
the appellant/revenue was whether a revised Form No. 10 could have been filed by
the respondent/assessee during the reassessment proceedings. To claim the benefit of
the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 11, the respondent/assessee had to file a
statement in the prescribed form, i. e., Form No. 10. The Tribunal has noted that there
is no adverse finding by the Assessing Officer concerning the fulfilment of conditions
subject to which the accumulation of income was allowed under section 11(2).
Accordingly the assessee is not precluded from filing a revised Form No. 10 during
reassessment proceedings. (AY. 2008-09)

Assessee filed its return of income claiming exemption under section 10(23A). In course
of assessment proceedings, assessee claimed exemption under section 11 and also filed
Form 10 along with application, seeking condonation of delay in filing same. Assessing
Officer passed assessment order without taking into consideration exemption claimed
by assessee. CIT (E) dismissed condonation of delay application preferred by assessee,
holding that assessee had no intention of filing Form 10 within due date and was not
prevented by any reasonable cause from filing same. On writ the Court held the delay
in filing Form 10 occurred because amendments went unnoticed by officials of assessee.
Assessment year 2016-17 was first occasion subsequent to amendments in section 11
and 13 by way of Finance Act, 2015. Therefore, there was no reason to disbelieve
explanation furnished by assessee to explain delay in filing Form 10. Further, mere
failure to claim accumulation could not be read as reasons to believe that assessee did
not intend to file Form 10. Order passed by Commissioner (E) is to be set aside and,
delay in filing Form 10 is condoned. Circular No. 07/2018, dated 20-12-2018, Circular

Property held for charitable purposes S. 11
The Tribunal's decision to uphold the exemption was erroneous. The Court clarified that
the term "wholly" in Section 11 pertains to the purposes of the trust, not the property,
and is akin to "solely," leaving no room for purposes to be only partially charitable
or religious in nature. Additionally, the Tribunal wrongly relied on a Settlement
Commission order, which is final and conclusive only for the specific assessment year
of the application, not for subsequent years. Consequently, the Tribunal's order was set
aside. (AY. 2007-08)

Assessee-trust is running Kalyan Mandapam on commercial lines for fees and cess like any
other persons carrying out business operations. Except a minimum amount of donations,
the assessee has not spent any amount for charitable purpose as per its objects specified
in the deed of trust. Receipts from the marriage hall related activities are more than the
specified limit as per proviso to S 2(15). Rejection of exemption is justified. Printing a
diary of trustees and their family members does not per se amount to diversion of trust
funds for the benefit of trustees. Amounts spent for the Diwali get-together of the trustees
in the course of carrying on activities of the trust cannot be considered as diversion of
trust funds for the benefit of trustees-No violation under section 13(1)(c). The assesseee
Trust is denied the exemption hence the depreciation is directed to be allowed on
commercial principle. When exemption is denied corpus donations is to be includable in

that if some profits were generated from such activities, the assessee could be granted
exemption provided the receipts from such profit do not exceed the quantitative limit
of 20 per cent. in terms of the second proviso to section 2(15). Further, the prohibition
against carrying on business or service of a commercial nature would not be attracted,
if the quantum of such profits did not exceed 20 per cent. of the overall receipts. The

Held, that the assessee is eligible to claim application of income towards acquisition of
fixed assets. Though, section 11(6) was introduced in the statute with effect from April
1, 2015, it was clarificatory in nature and applicable for the year under consideration
as well. The Assessing Officer, without verifying the submissions of the assessee, had
held that no proper system was followed for utilisation of the accumulated income and
that the capital expenditure could not be claimed as an application against accumulation
under section 11(2). The finding of the Assessing Officer is not in accordance with the
provisions of the Act. The matter is set aside to the Assessing Officer to re-examine the
assessee's claim. (AY. 2014-15, 2016-17, 2017-18)

had not challenged this issue. Hence, the first reasoning on which the Assessing
Officer disallowed the accumulation under section 11(2) did not survive. Tribunal
held that substantial justice should be preferred to technicalities in deciding the issue.

mentioned in form 10 of assessment year 2016-17 as to be applied to promote and

appeals to the Assessing Officer for fresh adjudication. Therefore, the issue is set aside
to the Assessing Officer for de novo assessment per ratio laid down by the Supreme
Court in Asst. CIT (E) v. Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority(2022) 449 ITR 1 (SC)
after affording an adequate opportunity of hearing to the assessee. (AY. 2011-12, 2013-

S. 11: Property held for charitable purposes-Charitable trust-Exemption under
section 11-Allowability-Audit Report in Form No. 10B not filed along with return-AO
is directed to verify the Form No. 10B filed by the assessee and allow the claim of
exemption under section 11. [Form No 10B]
Filing of Form No. 10B, would be directory in nature, as such, the AO is not powerless
to allow an assessee to file Audit Report, if not filed along with return, at any time
before completion of assessment. Further, filing of Form No. 10B beyond the due date,
could not disentitle the trust from exemption claimed under section 11. Accordingly,
AO is directed to verify the Form No. 10B filed by the assessee and allow the claim
of exemption under section 11. [AY 2016-17] [ITA No. 903/Chny/2023, dt. 13/12/2023]

S. 11: Property held for charitable purposes-Accumulation of income-Filing of audit
report in Form 10B-Before due date of filing of return-Not mandatory-Filed along with
the return-Direction of CIT(A) is affirmed. [S. 11(2), 139(1), Form 10B]
Held that the return was filed by the assessee on November 29, 2014, and form 10
was filed one day later on November 30, 2014. The assessee also brought on record
evidence of filing of forms 10 and 10B on November 30, 2014, which was within the
due date as prescribed under the Act and Rules. The audit report was filed in this case
on November 30, 2014, which was within the time as admissible under the provisions
of section 139(1) of the Act. Direction of the Commissioner (Appeals) to allow the
deduction under section 11(2) of the Act is affirmed. (AY. 2014-15)

filed before passing of the intimation-Denial of exemption is not valid-Fee for late
filing-Filed return within prescribed time-limit-Late fee is not leviable. [S. 139(1),
143(1), 234F, Form No 10B]
Held that that as on the date on which the intimation under section 143(1) of the Act
was passed, the auditor of the assessee-trust had already filed the audit report in form
10B, before such intimation under section 143(1) of the Act was issued. There was
no deliberate or mala fide intention on the part of the assessee or its auditor to file
the audit report in form 10B belatedly. The claim of application of income could not
be denied to the assessee only on the ground that the assessee or the auditor of the
assessee omitted to file form 10B along with return of income, when it was submitted
to the tax authorities before the intimation under section 143(1) of the Act was issued.
The assessee-trust had filed its return of income as on September 26, 2018, within the
prescribed time-limit under section 139(1) of the Act. Section 234F is not applicable.

of income-Non-corpus fund shown at figure higher than investment shown-Matter
remanded for fresh adjudication. [S. 2(15), 11(2), 11(5), 13(1)(d)]
Held that the audited financial statements, statement of income and the return of
income for the assessment year 2013-14 were not filed by the assessee during the
proceedings before the authorities but had been filed along with the return of income,
meaning thereby, that these documents were already available with the authorities
below, but they did not look into them. In the interest of justice and fair play, the
matter was to be remanded for fresh adjudication. That the balance-sheet of the assessee
showed that the capital fund shown by the assessee was utilised in fixed assets, capital
work-in-progress and current assets. Such amount represented the application of income
and, therefore, was to be excluded while calculating the amount to be invested under
the provisions of section 11(2) read with section 11(5) of the Act. Nevertheless, the
assessee had not represented the facts properly, the matter is remanded to the Assessing
Officer for de novo adjudication as per the provisions of law. (AY. 2018-19)

S. 11 : Property held for charitable purposes-Audit report-Filing audit report in
Form No. 10B is procedural in nature-For not filing audit report along with return,
exemption cannot be denied-Matter is remanded to the file of CIT(A). [S. 12A, Form
No. 10B]
Assessing Officer denied exemption under section 11 on reasoning that there was a
delay of 235 days in filing Form No. 10B (audit report). CIT(A) dismissed appeal by
stating that neither he nor the Assessing Officer were empowered to condone delay.
On appeal the Tribunal held that requirement of filing audit report in Form No. 10B is
procedural in nature and, therefore, not filing audit report along with return of income
was a procedural omission only and could not be impediment in law in claiming
exemption. Since due to confusion in interpretation of law audit report in Form No. 10B
was filed after specified period, delay in filing audit report in Form No. 10B deserved to
be allowed. Matter is restored to CIT(A) to allow exemption. (AY. 2021-22)

Sponsorship agreements with few Indian business groups-Neither sponsor nor assessee

Eligible for exemption. [S. 2(15), 12]
Assessee, an apex sports body in India representing country, claimed exemption under
sections 11 and 12. During the year, assessee entered into sponsorship agreements with
few Indian business groups and received certain amount as sponsorships. Assessing
Officer held that the nature of activities in respect of sponsorship agreements with
various sponsors is in nature of business and held that assessee was hit by second
proviso to section 2(15) and, hence, not eligible for benefit of exemption under sections
11 and 12. CIT(A) allowed the exemption. On appeal the Tribunal held that the assessee
is representing country under aegis of Government in amateur international sports
events and arranging these sponsorship contracts is in itself a great task for assessee as
sponsors were paying out of their profits for motivating assessee and sportspersons of
country in participating in international events. Therefore neither sponsor nor assessee
could be attributed any profit motive from outcome of these sponsorship agreements.

was still pending for disposal. Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to restore

under section 139(4)-Assessing Officer is directed to allow assessee's claim of

Assessee-trust had filed e-return of income on 9-2-2019 along with Form No. 10B
declaring total income at nil after claiming exemption under section 11. Assessing
Officer disallowed assessee's claim on ground that return of income was filed beyond
time limit prescribed under section 139(1). CIT(A) confirmed the action of the AO. On
appeal the Tribunal held that provision of section 139(4) with effect from 1-4-2017 lays
down that any person who has not furnished return of income within time allowed
under section 139(1), may furnish return for any previous year at any time before end
of relevant financial year or before completion of assessment whichever is earlier. Since
relevant assessment year ends on 31-3-2019, return filed by assessee on 9-2-2019 was
within provision of section 139(4). The Assessing Officer is directed to allow claim of
exemption under section 11. (AY. 2018-19)

Assessee-trust earned income from various sources and invested balance amount in
fixed deposits. Assessee neither filed Form 10 explaining purpose of accumulation of
income under section 11(2) nor filed any details of investment in fixed deposits before
Assessing Officer. Assessing Officer made additions. CIT(A) up held the order of the
AO. On appeal the Tribunal held that the assessee submitted that it had not filed Form
10 either with return of income or at assessment/appellate stages, but said Form-10
had been filed along with resolution of executive committee indicating accumulation
of income for purpose of objects of trust and also filed relevant proof of investment
under section 11(5). Assessee had also filed a petition for condonation of delay in filing
Form 10 and said petition was pending for disposal. Since assessee had filed Form 10
along with resolution of executive committee and petition for condonation of delay was
pending for disposal, matter is remanded back to Assessing Officer to reconsider issue
in light of Form 10 filed by assessee after disposal of application filed by assessee for

certain income which in her view were in nature of trade and commerce and denied

certain amount for purpose of building funds-Re development work-Delay in
redevelopment-NOC from Airport Authority-Application filed under section 11(3A)
was pending consideration before Assessing Officer-Section 11(3)(c) is not applicable-
Period of accumulation was ending on 31-3-2018 vide resolution dated 29-3-2018 and
in order to rectify said mistake revised Form 10 was filed by assessee stating period
of accumulation to be till 31-3-2023-Claim was under section 11(2) and not under
section 11(1)(a), revised Form 10 should be considered for determining accumulated
funds available with assessee under section 11(2). [S. 11(2), 11(3A), 11(5), 12A, 13(3)
(c), Form No 10]
Assessee is a charitable trust registered under section 12A. Assessee had accumulated an
amount of Rs. 4 crore during year 2012-13 for purpose of building funds. The assessee
did not have surplus money to set apart or accumulate under section 11(2). Thereafter,
assessee filed revised Form 10. Assessing Officer made additions in income of assessee
on ground that income accumulated under section 11(2) did not satisfy conditions laid
out under section 11(3). On appeal the CIT(A) deleted the disallowance. On appeal the
Tribunal held that the assessee has submitted that funds accumulated in financial year
2012-13 for redevelopment work could not be utilised in year under consideration as it
operated very close to Mumbai Airport and for any extension/redevelopment work it had
to take NOC from Airport Authority of India and because of said reason redevelopment
work of its school building was delayed. Furthermore assessee had filed an application
under section 11(3A) in this regard. Since assessee's application filed under section
11(3A) was pending consideration before Assessing Officer, section 11(3)(c) would not
apply to instant case. The Tribunal affirmed the order of the CIT(A). Assessing Officer
also rejected assessee's claim of accumulation of funds under section 11(2) on ground
that period of accumulation was stated to be ending on 31-3-2018 and, thus, assessee
did not have income which it intended to accumulate or set aside under section
11(2). Amount was decided to be accumulated for carrying out purposes of trust vide
resolution dated 29-3-2018 and in order to rectify said mistake revised form 10 was
filed by assessee stating period of accumulation to be till 31-3-2023. Further, mode of
investment was also as per section 11(5) as amount was deposited in scheduled banks
or co-operative societies as per section 11(5)(iii). CIT (A) deleted the disallowance. On
appeal the Tribunal held that since assessee's claim was under section 11(2) and not
under section 11(1)(a), revised Form No. 10, which stated period of accumulation till 31-
3-2023, should be considered for determining accumulated funds available with assessee
under section 11(2). Order of CIT(A) deleting the addition is affirmed. (AY. 2018-19)

the claim of the assessee under section 11 of the Act and restricted the donation paid
to the Council alone for disallowance. Therefore, there was no merit in denying the

Held that the Assessing Officer had not demonstrated how the business support
expenses paid to F Ltd. were not commensurate with the market value of the services
availed of from F Ltd. an entity said to be covered under section 13(3) and thus the
assessee violated the conditions under section 13(2)(g) of the Act. The statement of
assessable income, balance-sheet and statement of profit and loss account of F Ltd.
showed income. The disallowance is not sustainable. That salary expenditure to
faculty members was disallowed due to non-filing of qualifications and experience and
elaborate the services rendered by persons. The assessee had engaged highly technical
qualified persons in whole-time management activities of trust as well as regular time
teachers in business school. The details of educational qualification and experience in
absence of any other evidence to the contrary could not be said to be not just fair and
reasonable. That the payment as commission to consultants and counsellors is justified.
That keeping in view the invoices, quotations and student-wise list the disallowance of
expenses on computers to students is not fair and reasonable. Additions confirmed by
the CIT(A) is deleted. (AY. 2012-13)

The assessee, a charitable trust, had provided interest-free loans to trustees, who used
the funds to acquire immovable properties for construction of nursing college. These
properties were leased back to the trust. The Assessing Officer disallowed a lease deposit
of 25 lakhs, treating it as capital expenditure, and also disallowed hostel expenses
of ₹ 27,72,490 as unpaid during the year. Further, the AO found that the trustees had
received loans totalling ₹ 1,70,11,398, which were used to buy properties in their
individual capacities, violating Section 13(1)(c)(ii), leading to denial of exemption

specific grounds relating to disallowed expenditures and the use of loans for property

2011-12 to 2014-15 that the assessee was not engaged in any trade, commerce or
business and thus the mischief of proviso to section 2(15) was not attracted in the case
of the assessee, and there being no change in facts order of CIT(A) is affirmed. (AY.

Appellate Proceedings-Direction of Commissioner (Appeals) to avail of remedy under
Section 119 to file revised return is proper [S. 11, 119, 143(1), 154, Form No 10B]
Held that there was no denial of the fact that the claim for deduction under section 11
of the Act was not made in the return of income. The assessee had claimed deduction
under section 10(23C) of the Act in the return. As the form essential for claiming
exemption under section 10(23C) was not furnished, the claim had been rightly rejected.
Therefore, the adjustment made while processing the return, could not be faulted.
Tribunal also held that there is no error in the direction of the Commissioner (Appeals)
to avail of the remedy under section 119 of the Act to file a revised return. The assessee
was allowed an opportunity in the intimation to file a rectification application, if so
required, which was not availed of. Accordingly, the remedy of rectification of mistake
had to be availed of before resorting to the alternate remedy under section 119(2)(b), if
required. The assessee may file an application under section 154 of the Act to rectify
the mistake in the intimation, if deemed proper. The assessee was also free to avail of
the remedy under section 119 of the Act, if he so desired. (AY. 2022-23)

transferred directly to the balance-sheet. An addition was made as income. On appeal
the Commissioner (Appeals) deleted the addition. On further appeal the Tribunal
held that since there was a categorical finding that the sum under the Swachh Bharat
Abhiyan Scheme had been routed through the income and expenditure account. Order
of CIT(A) is affirmed. Assessee received funds from public sector undertakings and
then disbursed them as per the requirements of the State Government. It contended
that these funds never formed a part of the income of the assessee as the assessee was
not the owner of those funds but merely facilitated their collection and disbursal. Any
balance in the relevant bank account after the rehabilitation work was complete was to
be returned to the respective public sector undertakings. The AO assessed as income.
CIT(A) deleted the addition. On appeal the Tribunal held that the assessee was not the
owner of the funds received from the public sector undertakings in relation to the relief
and rehabilitation work in Uttarakhand. Order of CIT(A) is affirmed. (AY. 2015-16)

year 2013-14, the assessee claimed exemption under section 11 of the Act. The
Assessing Officer treated the activities of organising conferences, meetings and seminars
as business activities by invoking the proviso to section 2(15) read with section 13(8)
on the ground that the assessee was charging consideration in the form of sponsorships,
that the receipts from these activities exceeded Rs. 25 lakhs in terms of the proviso to
section 2(15) and denied the exemption claimed under section 11 by bifurcating the

total receipts into two components, namely, business income and charitable income
under section 11 and computed the income accordingly and brought to tax the business
income whereas the deduction was allowed in respect of charitable income. Accordingly,
he added Rs. 2,00,75,470 as net business income by apportioning the administrative
expenditure proportionately between the business and charitable receipts or income
based on the gross quantum of receipts under these heads. The exemption was allowed
to the assessee only in respect of interest, rental and miscellaneous income. On appeal,
the Commissioner (Appeals), after issuing show-cause notice under section 251(2) of the
Act, enhanced the income treating the entire receipts as business receipts and taxed it
at the rate applicable to companies. On appeal the Tribunal held that the assessee, in
order to protect and promote trade, commerce and industry had been organising the
activities of seminars, meetings and conferences in order to disseminate knowledge
on specialised issues to members and non-members on the subject with specialised
knowledge. During the events experts on the subjects were invited to speak on the
occasion and also participative discussion and interactions were held and members
and non-members were invited to such activities of the assessee. It was not organising
any trading programs to impart skill development courses by specialist and skilled
knowledge and certified courses but general meetings, conferences and seminars were
organised to discuss and debate issues in current topics, amendments of the Income-tax
Act, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, foreign trade policy and
other issues concerning trade, commerce and industries. During the year, the receipts
from the activities of holding and organising meetings, seminars and conferences were
Rs. 9,48,14,435 and the profits as computed by the Assessing Officer constituted only
2 per cent. of such receipts. Thus, the consideration charged by the assessee was just a
cost basis and nominally above the cost. However, if the administrative expenses were
allocated on a rational and scientific basis between the activities of holding meetings,
seminars and conferences on the one hand and other charitable receipts such as interest,
rental and miscellaneous income on the other hand, then there would be a huge loss
from these activities meaning thereby that the assessee had not been even charging from
these sponsors, participants, members or non-members sums enough to cover the cost
of the assessee and therefore it could be reasonably presumed that the assessee had
provided these activities below the cost. In the subsequent assessment year 2014-15,
the Assessing Officer had computed loss of Rs. 77,87,698. Therefore, the assessee was
not carrying on any activity of holding meetings, seminars and conferences for business
purpose but only in support of its main object and it charged from its participants,
members and non-members the amount of fee which did not even covers the cost of
holding such events. That the administrative and other incidental expenses of holding
and organising seminars, conferences and meetings were met out of other charitable
income received from interest on fixed deposit receipts, rental and miscellaneous
income. Hence, the assessee was entitled to exemption under section 11 as the activities
of the advancement of main object was not hit by the proviso to section 2(15) of the Act
even post-amendments. Tribunal directed the AO to allow depreciation as application
of income. As regards capital gains in respect of sale of old motor car and purchase of
new car, there is no opening written down value for the year. Even if entire cost claimed
as application of income, assessee is entitled to claim deduction of written down value

activities of assessee were purely research work and did not fall under section 2(15).
CIT(A) held that dominant purpose is charitable and did not carry on business hence
the exemption is allowed. On appeal the Tribunal held that since in earlier years, claim
of assessee was accepted and for current assessment year also, there was no change in
facts and circumstances, order of CIT(A) allowing the claim is affirmed. (AY. 2010-11)

Assessee-trust granted loan scholarships to Indian students in India for their higher education overseas. It filed nil return claiming exemption under section 11. Assessing Officer held that assessee had given loan/grants to various students who were studying outside India hence denied claim of exemption on ground that charitable purpose and its execution should be in India. CIT(A) allowed the claim. On appeal the Tribunal held that in assessee's own case for assessment year 2012-13 it was held that loan scholarships given to Indian students in India for education/higher education abroad would be considered as application of income for charitable purposes in India and, thus, would qualify for exemption under section 11.

On further appeal the Tribunal held that the assessee had applied for fresh registration under section 12AB in prescribed form within time allowed by statute. Original registration obtained under section 12AA would protect assessee up to assessment year 2021-22 for claim of exemption under section 11 as long as other conditions prescribed in section 11 to 13 had been fulfilled by assessee. Therefore, assessee would be duly entitled for claim of exemption under section 11 for assessment year 2021-22 (AY. 2021-22)

Assessee filed appeal before National Faceless Appeal Centre (NFAC) and submitted that relevant Form No. 10, which was filed before department explaining amount of money, which was yet to be spent and how they planned to spend remaining amount in course of next five years, needed to be examined and considered by Assessing Officer while framing assessment order, which was not done by him. NFAC dismissed assessee's appeal holding that there was no material on record to warrant interference with order of Assessing Officer. Tribunal held that since NFAC had not adjudicated issue on merits, matter is remanded back to file of NFAC for de novo adjudication. (AY. 2016-17)

from which were in excess of ceiling stipulated in second proviso of section 2(15). He
disallowed exemption under section 11 of the Act. CIT(A) allowed the exemption. On

disallowed claim concluding that assessee failed to e-file Audit Report in form 10B one
month prior to due date of filing return. CIT(A) affirmed the order of the AO. On appeal,
Tribunal held that requirement of filing Form 10/10B is merely directory in nature and
failure to furnish Form 10/10B before due-date prescribed under section 139(1) cannot be
so fatal so as to deny very claim of exemption under section 11(2). Since delay in filing
Form 10B is due to technical issues and was beyond control of assessee, procedural
requirement should not deny substantive claim of exemption under section 11. The AO
is directed to grant exemption under section 11. (AY. 2022-23)

before due date fixed for filing Form 10B. The AO disallowed the claim of exemption.
CIT(A) affirmed the order of the AO. On appeal the Tribunal held that the Assessee had
provided a reasonable cause of lapse on part of auditors in filing Form 10B hence the
Commissioner (Appeals) is supposed to take into consideration that non-filing of audit
report along with return of income was a procedural omission. Therefore the matter is
remanded to the file of Commissioner (Appeals) with the direction that he should take
into consideration Form 10B of assessee and pass an order afresh on merits as per law.

through Covid Pandemic which restricted normal activities and it was also an accepted
fact that many changes had been brought into Act regarding procedure of filing of
income-tax return as well as audit reports and certain technical glitches had been faced
time and again. Considering those aspects, CBDT authorized condonation of delays up
to 365 days for assessment year 2018-19 onwards and by Circular No. 16/2022 dated 19-

Assessee filed return of income disclosing nil income on account of it being registered
as a company under section 25 of Companies Act, 1956 as also registered under section

to persons referred to in section 13(3) without charging adequate rent or compensation
and had violated provisions of section 13(2)(a) and 13(2)(b) read with section 13(3).
Accordingly, he assessed total income of assessee at certain amount by denying claim
for application of income and exemption under section 11 on account of infringement
of section 13(2)(b) read with section 13(3). On appeal, Commissioner (Appeals) held that
difference between rental value adopted by Assessing Officer and rental value adopted
by assessee being less than 10 per cent, rent received by assessee could not be said
to be not adequate hence allowed benefits of exemption under sections 11 and 12 to
assessee. On appeal the Tribunal held that on facts order of Commissioner (Appeals) is

Assessee-society, registered under section 12A, which is engaged in arrangement,
management and enhancement of immovable property in order to earn rent, to earn
profit after sale, to earn donation etc. It had claimed exemption under section 11 in
respect of its rental income. Assessing Officer, rejected assessee's claim of exemption
under section 11 holding that assessee-society was advancing object of general public
utility and rent receipt from such activity was more than prescribed limit of Rs. 25
lakhs, therefore, activities of assessee were not for charitable purpose. Commissioner
(Appeals) allowed the benefit of exemption under sections 11 and 12 to assessee. On
appeal the Tribunal held that there was no material brought on record to support the
fact that assessee was acting with profit motive so far in activities carried out. Receipt
that assessee received was invested or expended for object of society and Assessing
Officer failed to bring on record as to why rental income was treated as commercial
income. Since receipt from rent was in course of actual carrying out of objects of general
public utility and same was below 20 per cent, Commissioner (Appeals) is justified in
allowing benefit under sections 11 and 12 to assessee. Tribunal also held that since
copies of receipts contained direction of donor that money were for construction of fixed
assets i. e. bhawans only and assessee had done that activity, Commissioner (Appeals)
was justified in allowing benefit of section 11 to assessee. (AY. 2016-17)

Assessee is a Board established by Central Government to act as a nodal agency in
developing activities of fisheries among various states in the country. Major source of
receipt was grants from Central Government, and outflow was utilization of grants for
projects developed by respective State Governments which were supervised by assessee.
Assessee based on stage of completion of project released grants to State Government.
Assessing Officer, held that the assessee did not utilise 85 per cent total grants-in-aid
received during year and funds received back as refunds from various projects during
year. He was of view that assessee had invested in equity shares of SDMSSL and thereby
had contravened provisions of section 13(1)(d) read with section 11(5). Accordingly,
he taxed shortfall in application of income below 85 per cent of total income of trust.
Commissioner (Appeals),held that on an incorrect appreciation of accounting policies
followed by assessee, Assessing Officer had rejected books, without actually bringing

grants received, spent and other activities. Such books were audited by independent
auditors-Assessee had been following accounting procedure as defined in GFR 230(5)
of Government of India and directions of Integrated Financial Division of Ministry of
Agriculture, Government of India (IFD) over years and treating all grants as liabilities
and only when grants were utilised by implementing agencies they were treated as
income and when utilisation certificates were received, they were treated as expenditure
irrespective of year in which grant was received, as per directions of Government of
India. There was no income element on grant of funds by Central Government, nor any
expenditure incurred merely by allocation. Assessee had spent 85 per cent of income for
objectives. Further, such an investment was made in SDMSSL, in financial year 2008-09
and not during current year and never in earlier years any objection on that aspect was
taken. Order of CIT(A) is affirmed. (AY. 2015-16)
DCIT v. National Fisheries Development Board. (2024) 206 ITD 20 (Hyd) (Trib.)
S. 11: Property held for charitable purposes-Gross receipt is more than Rs. 10 lakhs-
Primary purpose of an institution is advancement of objects of general public utility-
Charitable trust would remain charitable even if an incidental or ancillary activity or
purpose for achieving main purpose, is profitable in nature. [S. 2(15), 12A]
Assessee is a registered under section 12A and had derived income by way of
contributions from the head office, membership fee, income from publication of Indian
Foundry journal, other grants and donations etc. besides receiving interest on fixed
deposits. It had claimed exemption under section 11. Assessing Officer, rejected claim
of exemption on ground that assessee-society was advancing object of general public
utility and gross receipt of assessee from such activity was more than Rs. 10 lakhs
in previous year and, therefore, activities of assessee were not for charitable purpose.
CIT(A) affirmed the order of the Assessing Officer. On appeal the Tribunal held that on
similar issue in case of Indian Chamber of Commerce v. Dy. CIT [IT Appeal Nos. 933 &
934 (Kol.) of 2023, dated 22-12-2023] had held that if primary purpose of an institution
was advancement of objects of general public utility, it would remain charitable even if
an incidental or ancillary activity or purpose for achieving main purpose, is profitable
in nature. Since profit derived from services rendered as public utility service was very
meagre, Assessing Officer is directed to allow exemption under section 11. (AY. 2014-15)
