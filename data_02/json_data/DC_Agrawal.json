        "content": "INDIAN EXPRESS DATED 23 RD JULY 2025. 1. Dhankhar Accepting Opposition Notice to Impeach Judge Rubbed Govt the Wrong Way Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar’s unexpected acceptance of the Opposition’s motion to impeach Justice Yashwant Varma of the Allahabad High Court reportedly irked the Union Government. The Centre was preparing a similar motion in the Lok Sabha, hoping for bipartisan consensus to claim moral authority. However, the Opposition submitted its notice first in the Rajya Sabha, excluding NDA members to retain the anti-corruption plank. Dhankhar’s announcement of the notice led to confusion and a scramble by the government to gather signatures. The government&#39;s unease deepened when Dhankhar referred to a pending motion against Justice Shekhar Yadav and earlier allegations of misconduct in Parliament. The Vice-President’s resignation soon after—citing health reasons—sparked speculation, particularly as key ministers skipped a scheduled meeting with him. The episode reflects deepening tensions between the presiding officer and the government, with procedural decisions influencing political outcomes during a charged Monsoon Session. 2. 7/11 Mumbai Blasts: Pressure Cooker Theory Dismantled in Court The Bombay High Court’s acquittal of all 12 accused in the 2006 Mumbai train blasts case marked a major setback to the prosecution’s theory. Central to the case was the claim that bombs were hidden in pressure cookers placed on luggage racks. However, the court found significant flaws—witnesses lacked credibility and no Test Identification Parades were conducted. A key shopkeeper&#39;s testimony regarding the sale of cookers was deemed irrelevant due to lack of procedural corroboration. Forensic reports revealed the recovered parts were not from original Kanchan cookers. The bench also noted the improbability of passengers recalling standard-size bags used in crowded local trains. The ruling underscores the dangers of relying on circumstantial and unverified evidence in terror trials. The judgment not only dismantled a long-standing theory but also highlighted procedural lapses and insufficient investigative rigor in a case that had deeply impacted Mumbai’s collective psyche. 3. SC Allows CBI to Register 22 Cases in Bank-Builder Nexus to Cheat Homebuyers In a major intervention to protect homebuyers, the Supreme Court allowed the CBI to file 22 regular FIRs in cases alleging a nexus between banks and builders in NCR cities like Noida and Gurugram. Thousands of buyers, who had opted for subvention plans, were compelled to repay EMIs without getting possession of their homes. The SC acknowledged a prima facie case against banks and developers like Supertech and ordered full investigations, noting that CBI had already conducted extensive preliminary enquiries. The court also expressed concern over coercive orders from Gurugram trial courts and directed the district judge to investigate these. Additionally, it asked the CBI to consider inputs from amicus curiae Rajiv Jain for enhancing transparency in authorities like RERA. The judgment reinforces the judiciary’s proactive role in real estate frauds and signals tighter scrutiny over systemic financial exploitation of common citizens. 4. Delhi Raises Olympic Gold Cash Prize to ₹7 Crore, Offers Government Jobs to Medallists The Delhi government announced a substantial increase in cash incentives for Olympic and Paralympic medallists—raising gold rewards to ₹7 crore—and introduced job reservations under its revamped sports policy. This move aligns Delhi with states like Haryana and Odisha in recognizing sporting excellence. The new Mukhyamantri Khel Protsahan Yojana offers structured government jobs: Group A for Olympic gold/silver winners, and lower groups for other medallists, including at Asian, CWG, and national levels. Financial support is also extended to students performing at national and state competitions. In tandem, the government approved a laptop distribution scheme for top-performing Class 10 students and sanctioned ICT labs for Delhi’s schools, acknowledging a longstanding infrastructure gap. By linking sports success to employment and education, Delhi aims to build a more robust ecosystem encouraging youth participation in athletics, while also addressing digital access and academic support among school students. 5. Traffic Overhaul Planned for NDLS, IGI Airport &amp; ITO in Delhi The New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Traffic Police have initiated a major traffic management overhaul at three critical city zones: New Delhi Railway Station, Indira Gandhi International Airport, and ITO. These hotspots are notorious for congestion, pedestrian confusion, and unregulated vehicular flow. The initiative aims to streamline multi-modal transport, ease pedestrian crossings, and decongest arterial roads through realignment of signals, introduction of holding areas, and stricter enforcement. At IGI, focus is on integrating airport cabs and ride-shares, while ITO may see better lane management and re-routing of buses. The plan includes modern traffic monitoring infrastructure and possibly smart camera-based enforcement. These areas are not only high footfall zones but also symbolic of Delhi’s logistical and civic challenges. The reforms are expected to facilitate smoother transit and reflect the city’s ambition to prepare for future population growth, events, and global connectivity. 6. A Bridge to London – India-UK FTA Cleared by Cabinet The Indian Cabinet has approved the long-pending Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United Kingdom, paving the way for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming London visit. The finalized text of the deal is expected to be released soon. This FTA, under negotiation since Brexit, addresses tariff reductions, market access, investment rules, and digital trade. It is especially significant as it marks India&#39;s first major bilateral trade pact with a Western nation post-COVID. The agreement will offer easier access for Indian goods like textiles, automotive parts, and pharmaceuticals to UK markets, while also liberalizing visa rules and education mobility for Indian professionals and students. For the UK, access to India’s growing consumer base and fintech sector is a key gain. This agreement reflects India’s strategic realignment of trade policy towards bilateralism, aimed at economic diversification, employment growth, and geostrategic balancing amid global disruptions. 7. Why He Resigned – Editorial Insight on Dhankhar’s Exit The editorial &quot;Why He Resigned&quot; delves into the political and institutional undercurrents surrounding Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar’s abrupt resignation. Though officially attributed to health concerns, the resignation follows a fraught session in the Rajya Sabha, where Dhankhar accepted the Opposition’s impeachment motion against a sitting judge before the government could act. The editorial suggests this procedural neutrality clashed with the government&#39;s expectations of loyalty, reflecting deeper frictions between constitutional offices and executive authority. It also underscores Dhankhar’s pattern of occasionally asserting institutional independence despite being perceived as aligned with the ruling dispensation. His exit thus marks a critical moment in the evolving power dynamics between Parliament’s presiding officers and the government, raising questions about the scope of autonomy and procedural fairness in highly polarized political climates. The editorial calls for introspection on the part of both government and Opposition to preserve the sanctity of democratic institutions. 8. Clearing the Air on Coal – Explainer on Coal Policy and Environmental Concerns This piece explains recent developments in India’s coal sector in light of environmental and economic debates. Despite its commitment to net- zero emissions by 2070, India remains heavily reliant on coal to meet rising energy demands. The government’s latest policy seeks to balance energy security with environmental obligations by allowing captive and commercial mining, while also investing in cleaner technologies like coal gasification. Critics argue that such dual strategies create regulatory confusion and delay the shift to renewables. However, policymakers maintain that coal will remain critical for base-load requirements in the short-to-medium term. The explainer contextualizes this approach against India’s industrial growth, infrastructure needs, and rural electrification goals. It also highlights the international scrutiny India faces in global climate forums. Ultimately, the article underscores the challenge of phasing down rather than phasing out coal—a nuanced stance reflecting India’s developmental and climate realities. 9. China Breaks Ground on $170-Bn Dam Near Arunachal; India Concerned China’s construction of a $170 billion mega-dam near the Yarlung Tsangpo River, close to Arunachal Pradesh, has triggered strategic alarm in India. The dam—reportedly set to be one of the world’s largest—may potentially divert water from the Brahmaputra, a crucial river for India’s northeast. Though China claims the project is for hydropower and flood control, India fears it could impact downstream water availability and be used as leverage in future conflicts. The lack of a water-sharing treaty between the two nations exacerbates these concerns. Indian experts also worry about ecological consequences and the dam&#39;s structural integrity in a seismically active region. The development comes amid ongoing border tensions and adds another layer to Sino-Indian rivalry. India is expected to raise the issue diplomatically and accelerate its own hydropower and river management projects in the northeast to counter any strategic disadvantage. 10. National Sports Governance Bill to Bring BCCI Under Oversight The government is set to introduce the National Sports Governance Bill, which will bring all National Sports Federations (NSFs)—including the BCCI—under a unified oversight framework. Though BCCI receives no state funding, the bill mandates all federations to register with a National Sports Board, adhere to age and tenure limits, and be subject to Right to Information (RTI) provisions. It also proposes the creation of a National Sports Tribunal for dispute resolution. While the BCCI has historically resisted external oversight, citing its autonomy, the new framework seeks to enhance transparency and athlete welfare, particularly as India prepares to bid for the 2036 Olympics. The bill reflects the Centre’s push for cleaner, accountable governance in sports amid international pressure from bodies like the IOC. It also balances autonomy with accountability, ensuring that elite federations contribute to national objectives without becoming law unto themselves.

        "content": "Tax News-5 (on the basis  cases uploaded in August 2025) Estimation of Profit in Sahara Land Dealings Restricted to 20% and Additions Based on Loose Papers/Notional Interest Deleted Ashish Prafulbhai Patel v. DCIT [2025 (8) TMI 754 - ITAT Ahmedabad] In this case, the assessee, acting as a mediator in land transactions for Sahara City Homes of Sahara India Commercial Corporation Ltd. (SICCL), was subjected to search proceedings. Evidence showed his role was that of facilitator, with payments made at Sahara’s instance. The Assessing Officer estimated profit at 20% based on a letter, while the assessee claimed lower margins. The Tribunal upheld estimation at 20%, noting seized material corroborated profit margin. It held once income is estimated, further disallowances under Sections 40A(3) or 37(1) are unwarranted. On unexplained expenditure, telescoping against disclosed income was allowed. Interest income noted in seized documents was taxed in the current year, but additions for notional interest and unexplained cash deposits were deleted as unsupported by evidence. Additions solely based on loose papers without corroboration were also struck down. Thus, income was to be recomputed on 20% profit estimation while unwarranted additions were deleted. Genuineness of Share Sale to Arrow Upheld; Section 68 Addition Deleted and Exemption u/ss 11 & 12 Restored A.C.I.T. (Exemption) v. Dr. K.R. Shroff Foundation & Dr. K.R. Shroff Foundation v. D.C.I.T. [2025 (8) TMI 755 - ITAT Ahmedabad] In this case, the assessee, a charitable trust registered u/s 12AA, received 80 lakh shares of e-Infochips Ltd. as corpus donation from its trustee, which were later sold to Arrow Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. for ₹538.40 crores. The Assessing Officer treated the transaction as a colourable device, adding the amount u/s 68 as unexplained cash credit and also denied exemption u/s 11 & 12 by invoking section 13(1)(c). The ITAT held that the sale was genuine since over 500 shareholders, including a Gujarat Government entity, sold shares at the same price, and Arrow’s funding from its Mauritius holding company was duly explained. Relying on Vodafone International Holdings BV v. UOI (SC), the Tribunal rejected Revenue’s doubts on source and creditworthiness. Further, as none of the conditions under section 13(2) applied, donation of shares by trustee could not be treated as a benefit to him. The ITAT deleted the addition under section 68 and restored exemption u/s 11 & 12, holding the trust’s activities as charitable in nature. Transfer Taxable in AY 2014–15; Section 43CA Addition in AY 2015–16 Unsustainable Navketan Premises Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT [2025 (8) TMI 756 - ITAT Mumbai] The assessee, a real estate developer, sold four commercial units in “Hi-Life Mall,” Santacruz, Mumbai, on 13.07.2013, receiving full consideration through banking channels and handing over possession. The income was offered to tax in AY 2014–15. However, the AO sought to tax the difference between stated sale consideration and stamp duty value under section 43CA in AY 2015–16, relying on the later registration date and DVO valuation of 03.05.2015. The Tribunal held that once possession and payment were completed in July 2013, the transfer was concluded under section 2(47)(v) read with section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. Registration at a later stage was merely procedural and could not defer taxability. Since the income had already been taxed in AY 2014–15, taxing it again in AY 2015–16 violated consistency and finality principles. The DVO valuation was found irrelevant. Accordingly, the ITAT deleted the ₹3.56 crore addition under section 43CA and allowed the assessee’s appeal. Top of Form Additions Based Solely on Sworn Statement or Third-Party Records Held Unsustainable; Deletion of Unaccounted Deposits, Loans, Interest, and Cash Confirmed Bottom of Form DCIT v. No. 1 Auto Finance & Helpline Motor Finance [2025 (8) TMI 757 - ITAT Chennai] In this case, additions were made on account of alleged unaccounted deposits, interest, loans, and unexplained cash solely on the basis of a sworn statement of the assessee’s managing partner and certain third-party records. The ITAT held that such additions were unsustainable as the Revenue failed to produce any corroborative evidence such as ledgers, recipient confirmations, or independent material to prove the alleged deposits or interest payments. It reiterated the settled law that mere statements during search without supporting evidence cannot justify additions under section 153A for non-abated years. Similarly, additions based on an excel sheet found at a third party’s premises, without identifying lenders or borrowers, were deleted following CIT v. Sant Lal [2020 (3) TMI 692 - Delhi HC]. Regarding unexplained cash, the reconciliation furnished by the assessee was neither disproved nor found false by the AO, and since book balance exceeded physical cash, addition was unwarranted. The Tribunal upheld the CIT(A)’s deletion of both substantive and protective additions, deciding fully in favour of the assessee. Revaluation Proceeds Not Taxable u/s 28(iv); Reopening Void for Lack of Reasons ITO v. Damayanti Ramachandran (HUF) [2025 (8) TMI 758 - ITAT Chennai] In this case, the assessee HUF received additional profit share on account of revaluation of goodwill during reconstitution of a partnership firm. The AO treated the credited goodwill as taxable income u/s 28(iv). The Tribunal, however, held that section 28(iv) applies only to non-monetary benefits or perquisites, not to monetary receipts. Relying on Mahindra & Mahindra [2018 (5) TMI 358 - SC], it observed that revaluation proceeds credited and withdrawn by partners cannot be taxed as business perquisites. It further held that since the reconstitution was effected through a family arrangement among partners of the same family, it could not be termed a mere business arrangement as claimed by Revenue. Therefore, the CIT(A)’s deletion of the addition was upheld. On reopening of assessment u/s 147, the Tribunal found that the AO failed to record valid reasons, did not supply them to the assessee, and merely made vague references in notices. Citing GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. [2002 (11) TMI 7 - SC] and Kavee Enterprises (P.) Ltd. [2007 (9) TMI 219 - Jharkhand HC], it held that non-communication of reasons strikes at the root of jurisdiction, rendering reassessment orders void. Accordingly, assessee’s appeal was allowed and Revenue’s appeal dismissed.Top of Form Additions on Undisclosed Profit, Other Sources, and Capital Gain Remanded for Verification Shri Kishore Mohanlal Dingra v. DDIT [2025 (8) TMI 759 - ITAT Mumbai] In this case, the assessee’s appeal concerned multiple additions made by the AO for AY 2016–17. First, the AO had added ₹14.92 lakh as undisclosed business profit by applying a net profit rate of 32.87% on alleged unexplained turnover based on cash deposits. The ITAT noted that the assessee had provided a fresh working of such deposits showing no positive undisclosed profit. Since this required verification, the issue was remanded to the AO for reconsideration. Secondly, an addition of ₹31.03 lakh under “income from other sources” was made in respect of four unexplained credit entries. The assessee furnished fresh explanations with documents before the Tribunal. As these were not examined earlier, this issue too was restored to the AO for fresh adjudication. Thirdly, on the issue of long-term capital gain of ₹6.94 lakh arising from cancellation of a flat booking at Chembur, Mumbai, the assessee produced builder confirmations for the first time. This matter was also sent back to the AO for verification. The addition of ₹52,361/- for interest income was not pressed by the assessee. The grounds on charging of interest u/ss 234A and 234B were held consequential. Thus, the appeal was allowed for statistical purposes, with all major issues remanded to the AO for fresh decision after due opportunity to the assessee. Top of Form 7. Disallowance u/s 14A and Addition u/s 43CA Deleted; Forex Fluctuation Issue Remanded; Carry Forward of LTCL Denied Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. v. DCIT [2025 (8) TMI 760 – ITAT Mumbai] In this appeal, multiple issues concerning disallowances and additions came up for adjudication. The first pertained to section 14A, where the assessee had already disallowed ₹35.01 lakh towards expenditure relatable to exempt income. However, the Assessing Officer, without recording the mandatory dissatisfaction, invoked Rule 8D and made an additional disallowance of ₹21.31 crore. The Tribunal held that in the absence of such satisfaction, the disallowance was invalid and directed its deletion. The second issue arose under section 43CA, where the difference between actual sale consideration and stamp duty valuation of a property was ₹17.46 lakh, falling within the permissible tolerance margin of 10%. Relying on the precedent of John Flower India Ltd. , the ITAT deleted this addition as well. The third issue concerned foreign exchange fluctuation on redemption of preference shares by an overseas subsidiary, where notional entries under AS-11 had been booked. Since factual verification was lacking, the Tribunal restored the matter to the AO for fresh examination. Finally, the assessee’s claim of carry forward of long-term capital loss on STT-paid shares was rejected, with the Tribunal upholding the reasoning of the CIT(A) that such claims were not permissible. Overall, the appeal was partly allowed: the section 14A and 43CA additions were deleted, the forex difference issue was remanded, while the disallowance of carry forward of capital loss was confirmed. 8. Addition u/s 56(2)(viib) on Share Premium Deleted; Depreciation on Hospital Management Rights Allowed DCIT v. Max Hospitals and Allied Services Ltd. [2025 (8) TMI 761 – ITAT Mumbai] In this case, the Revenue challenged two major issues: addition of share premium under section 56(2)(viib) and disallowance of depreciation on a non-refundable deposit treated as an intangible asset. The assessee had issued equity shares at a premium based on the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method as certified by a Chartered Accountant. The AO rejected the valuation, pointing out that the projections did not match actual performance and that the assessee was loss-making at the relevant time. However, both the CIT(A) and the Tribunal held that as per section 56(2)(viib) read with Rule 11UA, an assessee is entitled to adopt either DCF or NAV method, and once a prescribed expert’s valuation is relied upon, the AO cannot substitute his own assessment of value. The ITAT further relied on Cinestaan Entertainment (P) Ltd. [2019 (6) TMI 1367 – ITAT Delhi] as affirmed by the Delhi High Court, which held that valuation based on projections cannot be rejected merely because actual results later differ. Accordingly, the deletion of the ₹10.73 crore addition was upheld. The second issue related to depreciation claimed on a non-refundable deposit of ₹25 crore paid for acquiring operation and management rights of Nanavati Hospital. The assessee treated this payment as acquisition of intangible rights eligible for depreciation under section 32(1)(ii). The AO denied depreciation on the grounds that it was conditional and refundable. The CIT(A) noted that depreciation had already been allowed in earlier years, and therefore could not be disallowed in subsequent years, especially since the rights acquired constituted intangible assets. Relying on Bangalore International Airport Ltd. [2022 (11) TMI 318 – Karnataka HC], which recognized such rights as transferable intangible assets, the ITAT confirmed that depreciation was allowable. Thus, the Tribunal dismissed all Revenue’s appeals, holding that valuation under DCF method cannot be interfered with by the AO, and that non-refundable deposits conferring business rights qualify as intangible assets eligible for depreciation. Penalty u/s 272A(1)(d cancelled due to lack of service of notices on NRI assessee Jayshree Nilam Patel v. ITO [2025 (8) TMI 762 – ITAT Ahmedabad] In this case, the issue concerned imposition of penalty under section 272A(1)(d) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, for failure to comply with notices issued under section 142(1). The assessee, a non-resident Indian residing abroad for the past thirty years, had not filed her return of income for AY 2017–18. Based on information from a search in the Navratna Group and subsequent disclosure before the ITSC regarding unaccounted on-money in real estate transactions, her case was reopened under section 147. Notices under sections 148A(b), 148, and 142(1) were issued, but according to the assessee, none were effectively served. She first became aware of the proceedings only upon receiving a demand notice under section 156 via email in November 2023. The Assessing Officer, treating her as non-cooperative, made an addition of ₹3.17 crore under section 69 and imposed a penalty of ₹20,000 under section 272A(1)(d). The CIT(A) confirmed the penalty, holding that non-compliance with multiple statutory notices justified its levy. However, the ITAT noted that no material was produced by the Revenue to show that proper service of notices was made in accordance with law, especially considering the assessee’s NRI status. Importantly, even the CIT(A) in quantum proceedings had restored the matter to the AO for de novo consideration, suggesting a lack of effective communication. The Tribunal emphasized that penalty under section 272A(1)(d) requires proof of willful default, which was absent here. The non-compliance was attributable to lack of service and knowledge, not deliberate defiance. Penalizing an assessee for a default beyond her awareness would be unjust. Accordingly, the ITAT cancelled the penalty and allowed the appeal. Depreciation on goodwill wrongly allowed – Revision u/s 263 upheld as AO failed to apply consistency with earlier disallowance Unique Mercantile India Ltd. v. PCIT [2025 (8) TMI 763 – ITAT Ahmedabad] In this case, the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax (PCIT) exercised revisionary powers under section 263 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, against the assessment order for AY 2018–19. The PCIT found that the Assessing Officer (AO) had allowed depreciation of ₹57.11 crores on goodwill, even though the same claim had been disallowed in the immediately preceding year (AY 2017–18). The PCIT observed that goodwill had been wrongly shown under the “Building” block at 5% depreciation, though it was an intangible asset, and there was no change in facts or law to justify a different treatment in the current year. The assessee argued that since depreciation had been allowed in subsequent years without objection, the principle of consistency should protect its claim. However, the Tribunal rejected this contention, noting that consistency applies when a claim is accepted year after year without objection, not when the same claim was disallowed in the first year itself and then wrongly allowed later. The allowance of an incorrect claim in later years could not justify its allowance in the current year. The Tribunal also emphasized that the AO had not conducted any meaningful inquiry into the depreciation claim despite clear grounds for disallowance, making the order erroneous and prejudicial to the Revenue. Accordingly, the ITAT upheld the PCIT’s order under section 263, affirming that the AO’s failure to disallow depreciation on goodwill in AY 2018–19, despite earlier disallowance and no change in facts, justified revision.

        "content": "IT Act 2025-2 CHAPTER XVI PROCEDURE FOR ASSESSMENT A.—Procedure for assessment ------------------------------------------------- (1) Analysis of section 268 1. Purpose of Section 268: This section deals with the powers of the Assessing Officer (AO) when examining a taxpayer’s return. It allows the AO to ask for returns, documents, and other information, and also provides procedures for special audits and inventory valuations if required. 2. Power to Issue Notice (Sub-section 1): Sub-section (1) authorises the AO to serve a notice on any person who has either filed a return under Section 263 or whose time limit for filing such return has expired. The notice may require the assessee to perform specific acts—such as furnishing a return of income (if not already filed), producing accounts and documents specified, or furnishing information in writing, including a statement of assets and liabilities. The liability of the AO is to ensure that the notice clearly mentions the requirements and allows reasonable time for compliance. The assessee, on the other hand, is obliged to furnish the return, documents, or statements demanded, thereby placing an affirmative duty on him to disclose information relevant to his tax liability. In brief, The AO can send a notice to: i. Any person who has filed a return under Section 263 , or ii. Any person who has not filed a return within the time allowed. The notice may require the person: (a) To file a return if not already filed. (b) To produce accounts or documents as required. (c) To provide written information (including a statement of all assets and liabilities , even those not in books of account). 3. Restrictions and Safeguards (Sub-section 2 & 3): Sub-section (2), places safeguards on the AO’s authority under sub-section (1). The AO cannot demand information on assets and liabilities not recorded in the books unless he has obtained prior approval of the Joint Commissioner. Similarly, the AO is barred from requiring production of accounts for periods earlier than three years before the relevant assessment year. The duty cast upon the AO is therefore one of restraint and due process—he must act within these boundaries. For the assessee, this means he is only required to comply with lawful requisitions that satisfy these safeguards. Sub-section (3) provides that not only the AO but also another prescribed authority may issue the notice referred to in sub-section (1)(a). The duty of the AO or prescribed authority is to ensure proper service of such notice. The liability of the assessee remains to comply with the notice irrespective of the issuing authority, as long as it is legally competent to issue it. In brief, The AO needs prior approval of the Joint Commissioner before asking for a statement of all assets and liabilities outside the books. AO cannot demand records older than 3 years from the relevant tax year. The notice under 268(1)(a) can also be issued by a prescribed income-tax authority . 4. AO’s Power to Inquire (Sub-section 4): Sub-section (4) gives the AO discretion to make further inquiries to elicit complete information regarding the income or loss of the assessee. The liability imposed on the AO is to use this discretion judiciously and only to the extent necessary for assessment. The assessee, conversely, must respond truthfully and provide clarifications or evidence when such inquiry is undertaken. In brief, the AO may conduct any inquiry considered necessary to gather complete information about the taxpayer’s income or loss. 5. Special Audit / Inventory Valuation (Sub-sections 5 to 7): Sub-section (5) provides that where accounts are complex, voluminous, doubtful, involve multiple transactions, or relate to specialised nature of business, the AO may direct the assessee to have the accounts audited or the inventory valued. However, the AO’s duty is conditional—he must first obtain prior approval of higher authorities (Principal Commissioner/Chief Commissioner, etc.) and also provide the assessee with a reasonable opportunity of being heard before issuing such a direction. The assessee’s liability here is to arrange for the audit or valuation through the professional nominated and submit the report in the prescribed form. Sub-section (6) provides that the nomination of the accountant or cost accountant is the responsibility of the Commissioner/Principal Commissioner or equivalent authority, not the AO himself. Thus, the AO is bound to act on such nomination. The assessee’s duty is to cooperate with the professional so nominated and provide necessary access to books, records, or inventory. Sub-section (7) makes it clear that the powers of the AO under sub-section (5) can be exercised even if the assessee’s accounts have already been audited under any other law, such as the Companies Act. The liability of the assessee is therefore to comply with such further audit or valuation without objection on the ground that a previous audit has been conducted. In brief, if the AO finds that- i.Accounts complex or voluminous, ii.Doubts in correctness of accounts, iii. Too many transactions, iv. Specialised nature of business, then, with prior approval of higher authority and after hearing the taxpayer, AO may direct the assessee: (i) To get accounts audited by an accountant. (ii) To get inventory valued by a cost accountant. Important points : i. The accountant/cost accountant is nominated by the Commissioner /Principal Commissioner. This applies even if the assessee’s accounts are already audited under some other law. 6. Time Limit for Audit/Valuation Reports (Sub-sections 8–10): These sub-sections provide that the AO is required to fix a period within which the assessee must furnish the audit or valuation report. He may extend the period on sufficient cause being shown, but the total period including extensions cannot exceed six months from the end of the month in which the direction was issued. This provision casts a liability on the AO to monitor deadlines and exercise discretion in granting extensions. For the assessee, the obligation is to ensure timely submission of the report within the prescribed or extended period. In brief, i. The assessee must submit the audit/valuation report within the period specified by AO. AO can extend the period for good reason, but the total period (original + extension) cannot exceed 6 months from the end of the month when the direction was issued. 7. Expenses of Audit/Valuation (Sub-section 11): Sub-section (11) provides that the liability for meeting expenses, including remuneration of the nominated professional, lies with the Central Government and not the assessee. The AO’s duty is to ensure that the expenses are determined in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Commissioner. For the assessee, this provision serves as relief—he is not financially burdened for complying with an audit or valuation directed by the AO. In brief, expenses, including accountant’s fees, will be decided by the Commissioner and paid by the Central Government, not the taxpayer. 8. Right of Assessee to be Heard (Sub-section 12): The AO is duty-bound not to use any material gathered during inquiry, audit, or valuation against the assessee without first affording him an opportunity of being heard. This ensures adherence to the principles of natural justice. For the assessee, it creates a right to explain, contest, or rebut such material before it is relied upon for assessment purposes. In brief, before using any material collected through inquiry, audit, or valuation against the assessee, the AO must give the assessee a chance to explain or object . 9. Definition (Sub-section 13): The term “cost accountant” is defined by reference to the Cost and Works Accountants Act, 1959. The liability of the AO here is to ensure that only qualified professionals are nominated for valuation purposes. The assessee, correspondingly, must comply with directions of such recognised professionals in furnishing information or access required for valuation. In brief, “Cost Accountant” means a cost accountant under the Cost and Works Accountants Act, 1959, holding a valid certificate of practice. 10. Summary for Taxpayer i. AO can call for returns, accounts, and asset statements if needed. Certain safeguards exist: prior approvals, time limits, and right to be heard. If accounts are complex or doubtful, AO can order a special audit or inventory valuation at Government cost. Assessee is not burdened with audit cost but must comply with timelines. This ensures fairness and transparency in assessment proceedings. The AO needs prior approval of the Joint Commissioner before asking for a statement of all assets and liabilities outside the books. AO cannot demand records older than 3 years from the relevant tax year. The notice under 268(1)(a) can also be issued by a prescribed income-tax authority . This applies even if the assessee’s accounts are already audited under some other law. AO can extend the period for good reason, but the total period (original + extension) cannot exceed 6 months from the end of the month when the direction was issued. Certain safeguards exist: prior approvals, time limits, and right to be heard. If accounts are complex or doubtful, AO can order a special audit or inventory valuation at Government cost. Assessee is not burdened with audit cost but must comply with timelines. This ensures fairness and transparency in assessment proceedings.",

        "content": "Written Submissions 14 Reopening on discovery of cash deposit in bank(Part 1) To, Date: xxxxx-202x The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) National Faceless Appeal Centre (NFAC), Delhi Respected Sir/ Madam, Subject: Appeal in the case of shri ABCDEFG [PAN: xxxxxxxx] for the AY 2012-13 against order u/s 147/144 passed by ld. AO in ITO xxxxxxxxxxx vide DIN No. xxxxxxxxxxx on 13/12/22xx. Appeal No. CIT (A), Delhi- xxxxxxxx, DIN: ITBA/NFAC/F/APL_xxxxxxxxxxxx Kindly refer to the notice dated 20-01-20xxx in the above case. It is respectfully submitted as under-. 1. Facts of the case- The return for the AY 2012-13 was originally e-filed on 29-10-2012 on a total income of Rs. 11,00,000/-. The return was processed u/s 143(1). Subsequently, the AO noted that assessee has made total cash deposit of Rs. 25,00,000/- in his bank accounts maintained with Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC, in short) and Central bank of India (CBI, in short). A notice u/s 133(6) was issued by the AO on 05-03-20xx with the prior approval of PCIT-23, New Delhi. It seems that said notice was not received by the assessee. Presuming non-compliance from the appellant notice u/s 148 was issued by ld. AO on 29-03-20xx. It is claimed by ld. AO that this notice was sent by speed post as well as email at the email id of ABCDEFG@yahoo.com. It is further mentioned by the ld. AO in the assessment order that there was no response to this notice. Similarly, according to ld. AO there was no response to the notice u/s 142(1) issued by him on 27-08-20xx. Subsequently, ld. AO collected further information from all the banks and found that there is a total cash deposit of Rs. 82,00,000/- as mentioned in para 4 of assessment order. The ld. AO seems to have further sent a notice u/s 142(1) on 18-10-20xx. The ld. AO sought the reply by 24-10-20xx. No such notice was received by the appellant. However, at the advice of his counsel the appellant had attended the office of the ld. AO. But the ld. AO proceeded to make assessment u/s 144 on a total income of Rs. 93,00,000/-. 2. Reasons recorded are not provided to the appellant - The ld. AO seems to have examined ITS details and noticed that during FY 2011-12 the assessee has deposited cash of Rs. 25, 00,000/- in his bank account with OBC and CBI. A notice u/s 133(6) issued by ld. AO which was apparently not responded as same was not received by the appellant. On this basis only, reasons seem to have been recorded and notice u/s 148 was issued. Reasons so recorded were never provided to the appellant. The appellant seeks your kind permission to file an affidavit (enclosed as Annexure- X ) to the effect that (i) he did not receive reasons recorded and also the notice u/s 148 as claimed by the ld. AO in the assessment order and (ii) the ld. AO did not provide the material/ information in possession of the AO on the basis of which reasons were recorded and assessment was framed. After receiving the ex-parte assessment order assessee filed a letter dated 10-01-20xx which was received by ld. AO on 21-01-20xx (copy of the letter is enclosed as Annexure- Z ) to provide to him- (i) Certified copies of the notices issued. (ii) Certified copy of the reasons recorded. (iii) Certified copies of complete material on the basis of which reasons to believe have been formed. (iv) Certified copy of the approval obtained from the higher authorities. (v) Certified copies of independent inquiries done by the AO before recording reasons. (vi) Certified copies of the proceedings including notices, prior replies etc. However, till date no such material has been provided to the assessee, even though assessee has filed appeal before ld. CIT(A). The appellant is unable to defend his case in absence of above material. Thus, his right of appeal is adversely affected. Accordingly, the appellant relies on the following authorities for the proposition that if reasons recorded are not provided to the assessee, reassessment cannot be upheld. (i) Where no reasons were provided to the assessee, the reassessment order cannot be upheld. In support of his proposition, reliance is placed on the judgment of the honour able High Court of Bombay in the case of CIT v. Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd. [2012] 21 taxmann.com 53/340 ITR 66 (Bom); the judgment of the honourable High Court of Karnataka dated August 14, 2015, in the case of Kothari Metals v. ITO [2017] 80 taxmann.com 163/[2015] 377 ITR 581 (Kar.) , the decision of the Tribunal Mumbai Bench in the case of Tata International Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2012] 23 taxmann.com 18/52 SOT 465 (Mum) and the judgment of the honourable High Court of Bombay in the case of CIT v. Trend Electronics [2015] 61 taxmann.com 308/379 ITR 456 (Bom) (ii) In the case of CIT v. Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd. [2012] 21 taxmann.com 53/340 ITR 66 (Bom) the honourable High Court of Bombay has held as under : \"The finding of fact---- vide order dated July 16, 2007”. (iii) Procedure laid down by Hon’ble Apex Court in GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. v. ITO [2002] 125 Taxman 963/[2003] 259 ITR 19 (SC) was not followed. It was held as under- “We see no justifiable reason to interfere----- the assessment in respect of the abovesaid five assessment years.” (iv) Hon’ble Karnataka High Court in Kothari Metals v. ITO [2017] 80 taxmann.com 163/[2015] 377 ITR 581 (Kar.) observed as under- \"The question of non-furnishing the------- for the reassessment could not have been taken further on this ground alone.\" (v) In the case of Tata International Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2012] 23 taxmann.com 18/52 SOT 465 (Mum.) , the Tribunal, after considering the decision in the case of GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. v. ITO [2002] 125 Taxman 963/[2003] 259 ITR 19 (SC) and CIT v. Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd. [2012] 21 taxmann.com 53/340 ITR 66 (Bom) held that when the Assessing Officer failed to furnish reasons recorded for reopening of the assessment within a reasonable time and prior to the completion of assessment, then the assessment order passed without supply of reasons as recorded for reopening the assessment is invalid and cannot sustain. (vi) Reassessment completed without furnishing the reasons actually recorded by the Assessing Officer for reopening of assessment is not sustainable in law because the Assessing Officer is duty bound to supply the same within reasonable time as held by the honourable Supreme Court in the case of GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. [2003] 259 ITR 19 (SC). The subsequent supply of the reasons would not make good of the illegality suffered by the reopening of assessment. A similar view has been taken by this Tribunal in the case of Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. (I.T.A. No. 71 of 2006 decided on November 27, 2006 (Bom.)) and decided a similar issue in paragraph 7 as under : “ It is settled proposition as laid down by the honourable Supreme Court----------- Accordingly, we set aside the reassessments for all three years under consideration being invalid.\" (vii) In similar facts, in the case of CIT v. Trend Electronics [2015] 61 taxmann.com 308/379 ITR 456(Bom), the honourable High Court of Bombay held that where jurisdictional issues involved the same must be strictly complied with by the authority concerned and no question of knowledge being attributed on the basis of implication can arise. (viii) Further reference on this point may also be made to the decisions in Manjula Athur v. ITO [2018] 91 taxmann.com 438 (Madras) and WIMCO SEEDLINGS LTD v. JCIT 2020 (6) TMI 586 - ITAT DELHI Thus, where reasons recorded by the AO for reopening the assessment are not provided, assessment needed to be set aside . 3. Mere cash deposit does not lead to belief that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. The assessment order mentions that as per information from ITS details, it is noticed by ld. AO that assessee has deposited total cash of Rs. 25,42,500/-. Notice u/s 133(6) issued was not received by the assessee and hence no reply could be submitted. Without further verifying as to whether above sum is of income character or not, or whether it is a capital receipt, ld. AO inferred that said cash deposit was not in conformity with the declared income, income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. Accordingly he issued notice u/s 148 and reopened the assessment. It is submitted that mere cash deposit is not enough to infer that deposits would be of income character and income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. In this regard, reliance is placed on the decision of the Tribunal in following cases- i. Bir Bahadur Singh Sijwali v. ITO [2015] 53 taxmann.com 366 (Delhi - Trib.) All that the reasons recorded for reopening indicate is that cash deposits aggregating to Rs. 10,24,100--------------- unless there is a reason to believe, rather than suspect, that an income has escaped assessment. ii. Gurpal Singh v. ITO [2016] 71 taxmann.com 108 (Amritsar - Trib.) Assessee deposited cash in his savings bank account but did not file return of income - -----of assessee and, therefore, action of Assessing Officer was not justified. iii. Saraf Gramodyog Sansthan v. ITO [2007] 108ITD115 (AGRA) In respect of bank deposit, it is necessary that a finding be recorded in reasons for reopening that same is not found recorded in regular books before inferring that same was chargeable to tax and, hence, it has escaped assessment; mere non-filing of returns does not lead to inference that any deposit in bank account would be chargeable to tax. 4. There is no independent verification by ld. AO: The information as per ITS has not verified by ld. AO by calling the bank statements before recording the reasons and issue of notice u/s 148. The reopening has been quashed in cases where notice u/s 148 was issued without verifying the information received from investigation wing or AIR: It is submitted that there are no fetters on AO to carry out preliminary inquiries before issuance of notice of reopening in order to collect information on basis of which he may either form a belief that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment or abandon any further inquiry, upon being satisfied that no such belief could be formed. The purpose of independent inquiry is to verify the facts and material contained in the information and to collect additional facts and materials which would supplement and support the inference that there was some income accrued or arisen to the assessee during the relevant assessment year which had not been offered for tax. For example- (i) Where Investigation report was reproduced in the reasons recorded without verifying the information, reopening held unjustified.- [ refer - Pr. CIT v. Meenakshi Overseas (P.) Ltd. [2017] 82 taxmann.com 300/395 ITR 677 (Delhi)] (ii) An information was received from the investigation wing, New Delhi, that the assessee was amongst the beneficiaries of bogus accommodation entries. The AO did not apply his mind so as to come to an independent conclusion that income had escaped assessment. He mechanically issued notice u/s 148. [refer- RMG Polyvinyl (I) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2017] 88 taxmann.com 351 (Delhi - Trib.) confirmed in PCIT v. RMG Polyvinyl (I) Ltd. [2017] 83 taxmann.com 348/249 Taxman 610/396 ITR 5 (Delhi)] headnotes from this decision are as under-. Section 68, read with section 147, of the Income-tax Act, 1961 - Cash credit (Accommodation entry) - -------income had escaped assessment and consequently, reassessment was unjustified - Held, yes [Para 13] [In favour of assessee] (iii) On the information received from IW that 'N' Ltd., a penny stock company listed in BSE was used to facilitate introduction of unaccounted income of members in form of share capital and assessee was one of those beneficiaries, the AO did not carry out any independent inquiry as 'N' Ltd. was not in existence at the relevant time. Thus, AO had initiated reassessment proceedings without conducting independent inquiries. [refer- South Yarra Holdings v. ITO [2019] 104 taxmann.com 216/263 Taxman 594 (Bombay ) Headnotes from this judgement are as under- “Section 69A, read with section 147 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 - Unexplained money (Shares) - Assessment years 2011-12 ------------ in view of aforesaid, impugned reassessment proceedings deserved to be quashed - Held, yes [Para 8] [In favour of assessee]” 5. Information from ITS is not correct and is wrong: It is written in the assessment order that in two banks i.e. OBC and CBI, the appellant has made total cash deposit of Rs. 25,42,500/-. It is on this basis that assessment has been reopened. However, bifurcation with respect to the two accounts has not been given. OBC has now become PNB (after merger). There is no cash deposit in this bank. A certificate from PNB bank has been obtained and enclosed as Annexure B . Therefore, information with the AO that there was a cash deposit in OBC in FY 2011-12 is incorrect. Had the ld. AO before issuing notice u/s 148 called for the bank statement directly from the bank he would have come to know that there is no deposit in the bank. Further, in CBI as per AO’s verification shown in para 4 of the assessment order, there is a deposit of Rs. 13,29,500/- and not Rs. 25,42,500/-. However, we have verified after obtaining bank statement from CBI (it was not provided by ld. AO to us even after framing assessment) that cash deposit is of Rs. 13,74,500/-. Bank statement from CBI is enclosed as Annexure C. Thus, the information relied upon by ld. AO for reopening the assessment is basically wrong and therefore, reopening made on the basis of wrong facts cannot be sustained. It has been held in following cases that where wrong facts are mentioned in the reasons recorded before issuance of notice u/s 148 or where AO has proceeded mechanically on erroneous information supplied by investigation wing, on the basis of which the ld. AO formed belief, the reopening would not be justified. i. Akshar Builders & Developers v.

Facts of the case- The return for the AY 2012-13 was originally e-filed on 29-10-2012 on a total income of Rs. 11,00,000/-. The return was processed u/s 143(1). Subsequently, the AO noted that assessee has made total cash deposit of Rs. 25,00,000/- in his bank accounts maintained with Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC, in short) and Central bank of India (CBI, in short). A notice u/s 133(6) was issued by the AO on 05-03-20xx with the prior approval of PCIT-23, New Delhi. It seems that said notice was not received by the assessee. Presuming non-compliance from the appellant notice u/s 148 was issued by ld. AO on 29-03-20xx. It is claimed by ld. AO that this notice was sent by speed post as well as email at the email id of ABCDEFG@yahoo.com. It is further mentioned by the ld. AO in the assessment order that there was no response to this notice. Similarly, according to ld. AO there was no response to the notice u/s 142(1) issued by him on 27-08-20xx. Subsequently, ld. AO collected further information from all the banks and found that there is a total cash deposit of Rs. 82,00,000/- as mentioned in para 4 of assessment order. The ld. AO seems to have further sent a notice u/s 142(1) on 18-10-20xx. The ld. AO sought the reply by 24-10-20xx. No such notice was received by the appellant. However, at the advice of his counsel the appellant had attended the office of the ld. AO. But the ld. AO proceeded to make assessment u/s 144 on a total income of Rs. 93,00,000/-. 2. Reasons recorded are not provided to the appellant - The ld. AO seems to have examined ITS details and noticed that during FY 2011-12 the assessee has deposited cash of Rs. 25, 00,000/- in his bank account with OBC and CBI. A notice u/s 133(6) issued by ld. AO which was apparently not responded as same was not received by the appellant. On this basis only, reasons seem to have been recorded and notice u/s 148 was issued. Reasons so recorded were never provided to the appellant. The appellant seeks your kind permission to file an affidavit (enclosed as Annexure- X ) to the effect that (i) he did not receive reasons recorded and also the notice u/s 148 as claimed by the ld. AO in the assessment order and (ii) the ld. AO did not provide the material/ information in possession of the AO on the basis of which reasons were recorded and assessment was framed. After receiving the ex-parte assessment order assessee filed a letter dated 10-01-20xx which was received by ld. AO on 21-01-20xx (copy of the letter is enclosed as Annexure- Z ) to provide to him- (i) Certified copies of the notices issued. (ii) Certified copy of the reasons recorded. (iii) Certified copies of complete material on the basis of which reasons to believe have been formed. (iv) Certified copy of the approval obtained from the higher authorities. (v) Certified copies of independent inquiries done by the AO before recording reasons. (vi) Certified copies of the proceedings including notices, prior replies etc. However, till date no such material has been provided to the assessee, even though assessee has filed appeal before ld. CIT(A). The appellant is unable to defend his case in absence of above material. Thus, his right of appeal is adversely affected. Accordingly, the appellant relies on the following authorities for the proposition that if reasons recorded are not provided to the assessee, reassessment cannot be upheld. (i) Where no reasons were provided to the assessee, the reassessment order cannot be upheld. In support of his proposition, reliance is placed on the judgment of the honour able High Court of Bombay in the case of CIT v. Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd. [2012] 21 taxmann.com 53/340 ITR 66 (Bom); the judgment of the honourable High Court of Karnataka dated August 14, 2015, in the case of Kothari Metals v. ITO [2017] 80 taxmann.com 163/[2015] 377 ITR 581 (Kar.) , the decision of the Tribunal Mumbai Bench in the case of Tata International Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2012] 23 taxmann.com 18/52 SOT 465 (Mum) and the judgment of the honourable High Court of Bombay in the case of CIT v. Trend Electronics [2015] 61 taxmann.com 308/379 ITR 456 (Bom) (ii) In the case of CIT v. Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd. [2012] 21 taxmann.com 53/340 ITR 66 (Bom) the honourable High Court of Bombay has held as under : \"The finding of fact---- vide order dated July 16, 2007”. (iii) Procedure laid down by Hon’ble Apex Court in GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. v. ITO [2002] 125 Taxman 963/[2003] 259 ITR 19 (SC) was not followed. It was held as under- “We see no justifiable reason to interfere----- the assessment in respect of the abovesaid five assessment years.” (iv) Hon’ble Karnataka High Court in Kothari Metals v. ITO [2017] 80 taxmann.com 163/[2015] 377 ITR 581 (Kar.) observed as under- \"The question of non-furnishing the------- for the reassessment could not have been taken further on this ground alone.\" (v) In the case of Tata International Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2012] 23 taxmann.com 18/52 SOT 465 (Mum.) , the Tribunal, after considering the decision in the case of GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. v. ITO [2002] 125 Taxman 963/[2003] 259 ITR 19 (SC) and CIT v. Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd. [2012] 21 taxmann.com 53/340 ITR 66 (Bom) held that when the Assessing Officer failed to furnish reasons recorded for reopening of the assessment within a reasonable time and prior to the completion of assessment, then the assessment order passed without supply of reasons as recorded for reopening the assessment is invalid and cannot sustain. (vi) Reassessment completed without furnishing the reasons actually recorded by the Assessing Officer for reopening of assessment is not sustainable in law because the Assessing Officer is duty bound to supply the same within reasonable time as held by the honourable Supreme Court in the case of GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. [2003] 259 ITR 19 (SC). The subsequent supply of the reasons would not make good of the illegality suffered by the reopening of assessment. A similar view has been taken by this Tribunal in the case of Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. (I.T.A. No. 71 of 2006 decided on November 27, 2006 (Bom.)) and decided a similar issue in paragraph 7 as under : “ It is settled proposition as laid down by the honourable Supreme Court----------- Accordingly, we set aside the reassessments for all three years under consideration being invalid.\" (vii) In similar facts, in the case of CIT v. Trend Electronics [2015] 61 taxmann.com 308/379 ITR 456(Bom), the honourable High Court of Bombay held that where jurisdictional issues involved the same must be strictly complied with by the authority concerned and no question of knowledge being attributed on the basis of implication can arise. (viii) Further reference on this point may also be made to the decisions in Manjula Athur v. ITO [2018] 91 taxmann.com 438 (Madras) and WIMCO SEEDLINGS LTD v. JCIT 2020 (6) TMI 586 - ITAT DELHI Thus, where reasons recorded by the AO for reopening the assessment are not provided, assessment needed to be set aside . 3. Mere cash deposit does not lead to belief that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. The assessment order mentions that as per information from ITS details, it is noticed by ld. AO that assessee has deposited total cash of Rs. 25,42,500/-. Notice u/s 133(6) issued was not received by the assessee and hence no reply could be submitted. Without further verifying as to whether above sum is of income character or not, or whether it is a capital receipt, ld. AO inferred that said cash deposit was not in conformity with the declared income, income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. Accordingly he issued notice u/s 148 and reopened the assessment. It is submitted that mere cash deposit is not enough to infer that deposits would be of income character and income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. In this regard, reliance is placed on the decision of the Tribunal in following cases- i. Bir Bahadur Singh Sijwali v. ITO [2015] 53 taxmann.com 366 (Delhi - Trib.) All that the reasons recorded for reopening indicate is that cash deposits aggregating to Rs. 10,24,100--------------- unless there is a reason to believe, rather than suspect, that an income has escaped assessment. ii. Gurpal Singh v. ITO [2016] 71 taxmann.com 108 (Amritsar - Trib.) Assessee deposited cash in his savings bank account but did not file return of income - -----of assessee and, therefore, action of Assessing Officer was not justified. iii. Saraf Gramodyog Sansthan v. ITO [2007] 108ITD115 (AGRA) In respect of bank deposit, it is necessary that a finding be recorded in reasons for reopening that same is not found recorded in regular books before inferring that same was chargeable to tax and, hence, it has escaped assessment; mere non-filing of returns does not lead to inference that any deposit in bank account would be chargeable to tax. 4. There is no independent verification by ld. AO: The information as per ITS has not verified by ld. AO by calling the bank statements before recording the reasons and issue of notice u/s 148. The reopening has been quashed in cases where notice u/s 148 was issued without verifying the information received from investigation wing or AIR: It is submitted that there are no fetters on AO to carry out preliminary inquiries before issuance of notice of reopening in order to collect information on basis of which he may either form a belief that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment or abandon any further inquiry, upon being satisfied that no such belief could be formed. The purpose of independent inquiry is to verify the facts and material contained in the information and to collect additional facts and materials which would supplement and support the inference that there was some income accrued or arisen to the assessee during the relevant assessment year which had not been offered for tax. For example- (i) Where Investigation report was reproduced in the reasons recorded without verifying the information, reopening held unjustified.- [ refer - Pr. CIT v. Meenakshi Overseas (P.) Ltd. [2017] 82 taxmann.com 300/395 ITR 677 (Delhi)] (ii) An information was received from the investigation wing, New Delhi, that the assessee was amongst the beneficiaries of bogus accommodation entries. The AO did not apply his mind so as to come to an independent conclusion that income had escaped assessment. He mechanically issued notice u/s 148. [refer- RMG Polyvinyl (I) Ltd. v. Dy.

Thus, AO had initiated reassessment proceedings without conducting independent inquiries. [refer- South Yarra Holdings v. ITO [2019] 104 taxmann.com 216/263 Taxman 594 (Bombay ) Headnotes from this judgement are as under- “Section 69A, read with section 147 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 - Unexplained money (Shares) - Assessment years 2011-12 ------------ in view of aforesaid, impugned reassessment proceedings deserved to be quashed - Held, yes [Para 8] [In favour of assessee]” 5. Information from ITS is not correct and is wrong: It is written in the assessment order that in two banks i.e. OBC and CBI, the appellant has made total cash deposit of Rs. 25,42,500/-. It is on this basis that assessment has been reopened. However, bifurcation with respect to the two accounts has not been given. OBC has now become PNB (after merger). There is no cash deposit in this bank. A certificate from PNB bank has been obtained and enclosed as Annexure B . Therefore, information with the AO that there was a cash deposit in OBC in FY 2011-12 is incorrect. Had the ld. AO before issuing notice u/s 148 called for the bank statement directly from the bank he would have come to know that there is no deposit in the bank. Further, in CBI as per AO’s verification shown in para 4 of the assessment order, there is a deposit of Rs. 13,29,500/- and not Rs. 25,42,500/-. However, we have verified after obtaining bank statement from CBI (it was not provided by ld. AO to us even after framing assessment) that cash deposit is of Rs. 13,74,500/-. Bank statement from CBI is enclosed as Annexure C. Thus, the information relied upon by ld. AO for reopening the assessment is basically wrong and therefore, reopening made on the basis of wrong facts cannot be sustained. It has been held in following cases that where wrong facts are mentioned in the reasons recorded before issuance of notice u/s 148 or where AO has proceeded mechanically on erroneous information supplied by investigation wing, on the basis of which the ld. AO formed belief, the reopening would not be justified. i. Akshar Builders & Developers v.

        "content": "Income tax Q and A-16 Section 54/54F -6 Q51. Whether the assessee is entitled to exemption under Section 54F when only part consideration was paid for purchase of a flat and the sale deed had not been executed? Ans. The Tribunal noted that the assessee later produced additional evidence: A share certificate from the Co-operative Housing Society showing ownership, A seller’s ledger account confirming that the full purchase consideration had been paid, and A letter of possession from the seller. Since these crucial documents had not been considered by the AO or CIT(A), the Tribunal held that the matter required fresh examination. Accordingly, it remanded the issue back to the AO for de novo adjudication , setting aside the earlier disallowance of Section 54F claim. The Tribunal’s reasoning rests on the principle that exemption under Section 54F depends on whether the assessee has actually purchased a residential property within the stipulated period. The AO’s objection was that merely entering into an agreement to sell and paying partial consideration does not amount to “purchase,” especially when possession was conditional upon full payment. However, the assessee substantiated ownership by producing additional evidence: the share certificate issued by the housing society, proof in the seller’s ledger that the entire consideration was ultimately paid, and a possession letter. These documents were material to establish both ownership and payment compliance. Since such evidence was not evaluated by the lower authorities, denying the exemption outright would amount to miscarriage of justice. The Tribunal emphasized the need to balance technical compliance with substantive justice, particularly when evidence is available to support the taxpayer’s claim. Thus, instead of deciding conclusively, it remanded the matter to the AO for fresh adjudication, directing that all material must be duly considered and the assessee be given fair opportunity to explain. This reflects the judiciary’s approach of ensuring natural justice in tax matters rather than adhering to a rigid technicality. Madan Mohan Mishra v. ITO [2024] 160 taxmann.com 42 (Mumbai Trib.) Q52. Is an assessee entitled to exemption under Section 54 when the flat was booked under an apartment buyer agreement prior to the sale, but both sale and possession of the flat were completed within three years from the sale of the original house? Ans. The Court upheld the Tribunal’s view that the assessee was entitled to Section 54 relief. It held that once the sale and possession of the under-construction flat were completed within three years from the date of sale of the old house , the statutory conditions stood satisfied. The Court further noted that this interpretation was consistent with its earlier judgment in Pr. CIT v. Akshay Sobti [2020] 423 ITR 321 (Delhi). Accordingly, the appeal of the Revenue was dismissed as raising no substantial question of law. The Delhi High Court emphasized that Section 54 is a beneficial provision intended to grant relief to taxpayers who reinvest their long-term capital gains into residential property. The Revenue’s technical objection—that the apartment buyer agreement predated the sale of the original house—was rejected because the law allows not only “purchase” within one year before or two years after, but also “construction” within three years of the sale. In this case, although the agreement was earlier, the critical event was the completion of sale and possession of the flat, which occurred within three years. Relying on its own precedent in Akshay Sobti , the Court reiterated that acquisition of a flat through a builder under a buyer’s agreement amounts to “construction,” not mere “purchase.” Therefore, once the assessee had taken possession and the transaction was completed within the permissible period, the exemption could not be denied. The Court also reminded that beneficial provisions must be interpreted liberally once the eligibility criteria are met. Since the Tribunal’s view aligned with binding precedent, the High Court held there was no “substantial question of law” for further interference. Hence, the assessee’s claim under Section 54 was upheld. CIT (IT) v. Reema Chawla [2024] 161 taxmann.com 422 (Delhi) Q53. Whether the assessee, who received 15 residential apartment units under a Joint Development Agreement (JDA), could claim exemption under Section 54F in respect of all units, or whether the benefit was confined only to one residential unit as contended by the Assessing Officer? Ans. The Tribunal held that the amendment made by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2014—substituting the word “a” with “one” residential house—was prospective , applicable only from 01.04.2015. For earlier years, the expression “a residential house” could include multiple units. Relying on Karnataka High Court and Madras High Court precedents, the Tribunal decided in favour of the assessee , confirming that he was entitled to Section 54F exemption for all 15 units received under the JDA. The Tribunal’s reasoning was grounded in statutory interpretation and judicial precedent. Prior to 01.04.2015, Section 54F used the expression “a residential house.” Courts, including the Karnataka High Court in CIT v. Rukminiamma and D. Ananda Basappa , had consistently interpreted this phrase to include multiple units, as the indefinite article “a” could mean singular or plural depending on the context. The Finance (No. 2) Act, 2014 amended the provision by replacing “a” with “one,” thereby restricting the exemption to a single residential unit. However, this amendment was explicitly made prospective . Therefore, for AY 2008-09, when the assessee received 15 apartments under a JDA, he could legitimately claim exemption on all the units. The Tribunal also drew support from the Madras High Court in CIT v. V.R. Karpagam , which clarified that principles under Section 54 apply pari passu to Section 54F. By affirming that beneficial provisions must be construed liberally when the assessee meets the eligibility criteria, the Tribunal rejected the Revenue’s restrictive interpretation. Consequently, the appeal of the Revenue was dismissed, and the assessee’s right to claim exemption for all 15 units was upheld. ACIT v. Narayanappa Ramanna [2024] 162 taxmann.com 739 (Bang. Trib.) Q54. Whether exemption under Section 54F can be claimed on capital gains arising from the sale of a depreciable asset (office premises) where Section 50 deems the gain to be short-term, even though the property was held for more than 36 months? Ans. The Tribunal held that the deeming fiction of Section 50 is limited to the computation and taxability of capital gains as short-term, but it does not alter the character of the underlying asset, which remained a long-term capital asset since it was held for more than 36 months. Therefore, exemption under Section 54F could be claimed. However, as depreciation had been claimed, Section 41(2) (business income on recaptured depreciation) also applied. The Tribunal remanded the matter to the AO to recompute income under Sections 41(2) and 50, and then allow Section 54F exemption if all other conditions were satisfied. The Tribunal clarified an important interpretative point: Section 50 creates only a limited deeming fiction. It requires that capital gains on sale of depreciable assets be taxed as short-term capital gains, regardless of the holding period. However, this fiction does not convert the nature of the asset itself from long-term to short-term. In the present case, the assessee’s office property had been held for more than 36 months, and thus continued to be a long-term capital asset . Therefore, even though the gain was taxed as short-term due to Section 50, the assessee could still avail the benefit of Section 54F, which applies to transfers of long-term assets. This interpretation is consistent with precedents such as CIT v. Ace Builders Pvt. Ltd. (Bom HC) and CIT v. V.S. Dempo Co. Ltd. (SC), which held that deeming provisions must be applied strictly and only for the purpose for which they are enacted. The Tribunal also pointed out that while the AO was bound by the assessee’s omission in the original return, appellate authorities are not so restricted and can entertain additional claims. Accordingly, the case was remanded for fresh computation, with directions that Section 54F exemption be granted if other statutory conditions were met. Sonia Pathak Khanna v. ITO [2024] 164 taxmann.com 607 (Mumbai - Trib.) Q55. Whether an assessee can claim exemption under Section 54F when the construction of a new residential house was completed more than seven years after the transfer of the original asset, citing developer disputes as a reason for delay? Ans. The Tribunal rejected the claim. It held that Section 54F requires the assessee to purchase a house within two years or construct one within three years from the date of transfer. Since construction was completed in 2023—over seven years later—the statutory condition was not met. The Tribunal further observed that the developer’s disputes arose only in 2021, which was already beyond the three-year window, and the assessee failed to prove that any steps were taken to ensure timely completion. Thus, exemption under Section 54F was denied . The Tribunal’s decision rests on the strict construction of time-bound conditions in Section 54F. This section provides a tax benefit only when the assessee reinvests capital gains into residential property within the specific period prescribed: purchase within two years or construction within three years of transfer. In this case, the transfer under the JDA took place in May 2016, so the deadline for completion was May 2019. However, construction was completed only in November 2023, i.e., more than four years after the statutory period had lapsed. The assessee argued that litigation between the developer’s partners caused the delay, but the Tribunal noted that such disputes began only in October 2021—well after the statutory period had already expired. Moreover, the assessee failed to demonstrate due diligence or efforts to enforce her contractual rights during the seven-year delay. The Tribunal emphasized that beneficial provisions like Section 54F, while liberal in intent, cannot override explicit statutory timelines. Thus, since both the purchase and construction requirements were not met within the permissible period, the exemption could not be granted. The decision reinforces the principle that procedural timelines under tax exemptions are mandatory and not subject to equitable relaxation. Smt. Lekha Reddy Mettu v. ACIT [2024] 163 taxmann.com 303 (Hyd. Trib.) Q56. For claiming exemption under Section 54, should the relevant date be the agreement to purchase an under-construction flat (21-06-2014) or the date of possession (16-11-2015)? Ans. The Tribunal held that the relevant date is the date of possession of the new residential property, not the date of the agreement. Since possession was received on 16-11-2015—well within two years of the sale of the original property (22-07-2015)—the assessee’s claim under Section 54 was valid. Accordingly, the Tribunal allowed the exemption. The Tribunal emphasized the principle that Section 54, being a beneficial provision , must be interpreted liberally to promote reinvestment in housing. At the time of entering into the purchase agreement (21-06-2014), the property was still under construction and thus could not be regarded as a “residential house.” A residential property comes into existence only once the builder obtains the occupancy certificate and hands over possession. Judicial precedents, such as CIT v. Beena K. Jain (Bom HC), have established that the date of possession and completion is the decisive point for Section 54 eligibility, not the earlier booking date. Applying this reasoning, the Tribunal concluded that since possession and occupancy certificate were both secured in 2015, the assessee satisfied the statutory requirement of purchasing a new property within two years of selling the old one. The Assessing Officer’s narrow interpretation—treating the agreement date as final—was rejected, as it ignored the substance of the transaction. Thus, the Tribunal held that the assessee rightfully deserved the exemption, reinforcing that the beneficial nature of Section 54 should not be frustrated by rigid technicalities. Prateek Rajendra Kapadia v. ITO [2024] 164 taxmann.com 762 (Mumbai - Trib.) Q57. For the purpose of Section 54, should the date of purchase be taken as the agreement date (2009) or the possession date (2011) when the flat became inhabitable? Ans. The Tribunal ruled in favour of the assessee. It held that in the case of under-construction flats, the relevant date of purchase is the date of possession/handing over of the completed flat , not the date of the initial purchase agreement. Therefore, the assessee was entitled to claim exemption under Section 54. The Tribunal emphasized that Section 54 is a beneficial provision designed to encourage reinvestment of capital gains into residential housing. When an assessee enters into an agreement for an under-construction property, he merely acquires a right to purchase ; the actual “purchase” is completed only when the property is ready for occupation and possession is handed over. In this case, although the agreement was signed in July 2009, the flat was completed and possession was given on 02-02-2011—just days before the sale of the old property on 10-02-2011. Judicial precedents, such as CIT v. Beena K. Jain (Bom HC), Pr. CIT v. Akshay Sobti (Delhi HC), and Bastimal K. Jain v. ITO (Mum Trib.), all establish that possession and completion of construction are the decisive factors. The Tribunal also noted that in computing capital gains, even the AO had considered allotment/possession dates as relevant for acquisition. Hence, consistency required adopting possession date for Section 54 as well. Since possession was obtained within the statutory window, the assessee satisfied the condition. Thus, exemption under Section 54 was rightly allowable, reaffirming the principle that substance of the transaction prevails over mere technicalities. Sunil Amritlal Shah v. ITO [2024] 162 taxmann.com 676 (Mumbai - Trib.) Q58. Can exemption under Section 54 be denied solely on the technical ground that the assessee did not file a return of income, even though all statutory conditions for exemption were substantively fulfilled? Ans. The Tribunal held that when substantive conditions for Section 54 are satisfied and documentary evidence supports the claim, the benefit cannot be denied on mere technicalities like non-filing of return. The Assessing Officer was directed to recompute income after allowing Section 54 exemption. The Tribunal emphasized that tax exemptions under Section 54 flow from substantive statutory compliance , not procedural lapses. In this case, the assessee had indeed sold a long-term residential property and reinvested the gains into another residential house within the permissible time. The Assessing Officer himself admitted in his remand report that all conditions of Section 54 were met. The only objection was that the assessee had not filed a return claiming the exemption. The Tribunal rejected this reasoning, noting that substantive law confers the benefit once eligibility conditions are fulfilled; it cannot be taken away on technical grounds. Reference was made to Article 265 of the Constitution , which mandates that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law. Since the assessee was not liable to tax after reinvestment, levying tax merely because of non-filing of return would violate this constitutional safeguard. The Tribunal also relied on precedents such as Smt. Sneh Lata Jain v. CIT (J&K HC) and clarified that while an Assessing Officer may be constrained by procedural bars (per Goetze India Ltd. ), appellate authorities like the Tribunal are not so limited. Accordingly, the claim under Section 54 was allowed. Seema Heera v. ACIT [2024] 164 taxmann.com 329 / [2024] 207 ITD 788 (Mumbai - Trib.) Q59. Whether ownership of a farm property with a bungalow and residential facilities disqualifies the assessee from claiming deduction under Section 54F, even if the assessee claims it was used for agricultural or commercial purposes? Ans. The Tribunal held against the assessee , deciding that the Vishubaug farm property was indeed a residential house. It observed that the bungalow on the farm was habitable, furnished, and used for residential purposes. Further, since the entire investment in the property came from the assessee’s own funds, joint registration with family members did not alter ownership. Thus, as the assessee already owned two residential properties, he was not eligible for deduction under Section 54F. The Tribunal’s reasoning emphasized the restrictive conditions under Section 54F. The proviso to Section 54F bars exemption if, on the date of transfer of the original asset, the assessee owns more than one residential house other than the new property purchased. In this case, evidence from inspection reports and photographs established that the Vishubaug property had a fully developed bungalow, surrounded by verandahs, furnished with household items, and capable of residential use. Although the assessee argued that the property was for agricultural and dairy purposes, he failed to declare any agricultural income in his tax returns. The Tribunal also referred to the Orissa High Court’s ruling in State of Orissa v. Ramchandra Chaudhary (1962) 46 ITR 246 , holding that dairy farming is not agricultural income, thereby weakening the assessee’s claim. Moreover, joint registration of property with wife and daughter was disregarded, since the assessee had funded the entire investment; mere co-registration could not shield him from the statutory bar. Accepting such arguments, the Tribunal observed, would open a loophole for tax avoidance. Therefore, since the assessee owned more than one residential property at the relevant time, his claim under Section 54F was rightly denied. Atul Govindji Shroff v. DCIT [2024] 166 taxmann.com 246 (Ahmedabad - Trib.) Q60. Can exemption under Section 54 be denied if the assessee uses other funds (not the exact sale consideration) for constructing a new house, and files a return under section 139(4) instead of section 139(1)? Ans. The Tribunal ruled in favour of the assessee . It held that Section 54 does not mandate that only the sale proceeds must be used; the use of other funds is also valid so long as a residential house is purchased/constructed within the statutory timelines. Further, investments made before filing a return under section 139(4) amount to sufficient compliance. Therefore, the assessee was eligible for deduction under Section 54. The Tribunal emphasized the beneficial nature of Section 54, which aims to encourage reinvestment of capital gains into housing. It clarified that the provision requires the assessee to “purchase within one year before or two years after” or “construct within three years” a residential house. There is no stipulation that the very same sale proceeds must be used; even borrowed funds or other resources can be applied. Thus, if the cost of the new house exceeds the capital gains, exemption is allowable up to the amount of gains. In this case, although some payments were made before the sale, construction was completed within three years, fulfilling statutory intent. Regarding the delay in filing return, the Tribunal relied on decisions such as Manilal Dasbhai Makwana v. ITO and C. Aryama Sundaram v. CIT , holding that compliance with section 54(2) is met if capital gains are invested before filing the return under section 139(4). The requirement to deposit into the Capital Gains Account Scheme applies only when funds remain unutilized. Since here the funds were already invested, no such deposit was necessary. Thus, by adopting a liberal interpretation consistent with legislative intent, the Tribunal upheld the assessee’s claim under Section 54. Jignesh Jaysukhlal Ghiya v. DCIT [2024] 166 taxmann.com 40 (Ahmedabad - Trib.)

        "content": "Income Tax Q and A -15 Section 54/54F-5 Q41. For the purpose of exemption under Section 54 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, should the date of possession of a newly constructed flat be treated as the date of purchase, rather than the earlier agreement date? Ans. The Tribunal ruled in favour of the assessee , holding that: The date of possession of the new flat (24-12-2018) is the relevant date of purchase for the purpose of Section 54, not merely the agreement date. At the time of agreement in 2016, the flat was not yet constructed; the assessee only had a right to acquire it in future. Relying on CIT v. Beena K. Jain (Bom. HC), the Tribunal clarified that acquisition is complete only when the property is ready, full consideration is paid, and possession is handed over. Since possession was within two months of selling the old bungalow (23-10-2018), the assessee satisfied Section 54 conditions and was entitled to exemption. The Tribunal highlighted that the substance of the transaction is crucial in interpreting Section 54. The object of the provision is to grant relief where capital gains are reinvested in residential property, not to deny exemption on technicalities. At the time of agreement in December 2016, the flat was under construction and no habitable property existed. Thus, the assessee had only acquired a contractual right, not a residential house. The Tribunal relied on the Bombay High Court’s ruling in CIT v. Beena K. Jain (217 ITR 363) , which held that the relevant date for Section 54 is when the assessee pays consideration and receives possession of a completed flat. Similarly, in Ayushi Patni v. DCIT , the Pune Tribunal had treated possession date as decisive. Applying these precedents, the Tribunal ruled that the flat was effectively “purchased” only on 24-12-2018, when the builder handed over possession, which was well within the two-year statutory limit from the sale of the old house. Thus, the exemption under Section 54 was rightly allowable. This approach ensures that the beneficial provision achieves its legislative intent of encouraging housing reinvestment and avoids unjust denial of relief based on premature agreement dates. Sanjay Vasant Jumde v. ITO [2023] 148 taxmann.com 34 / [2023] 200 ITD 285 (Pune - Trib.) Q42. Does Section 54F relief depend on completion/possession of the house within three years, or on investment of capital gains within the prescribed period? Ans. The Tribunal ruled in favour of the assessee , holding that: Section 54F requires that the capital gains be invested in purchase or construction within the prescribed time, not that construction must be fully completed or possession handed over. In this case, payments for purchase of property and construction were duly made within the time limit, and that too from the Capital Gains Account. Hence, denial of exemption merely on the ground that construction was incomplete was without merit. The assessee was entitled to deduction under Section 54F. The Tribunal emphasized the beneficial nature of Section 54F, which aims to incentivize reinvestment of capital gains into housing. It rejected the Commissioner (Appeals)’s reasoning that exemption could be denied solely because construction was incomplete or possession was not given within three years. Judicial precedents, including Smt. Shashi Verma v. CIT (MP HC) and Pr. CIT v. C. Gopalaswamy (Kar. HC), have clarified that what matters is substantial investment within the statutory period, not completion. The Tribunal noted that the assessee had deposited gains in the Capital Gains Account Scheme and used the funds for purchasing property and construction. These facts were undisputed, and even acknowledged by the Commissioner (Appeals). By contrast, denying exemption for lack of completion would unfairly penalize taxpayers for delays often outside their control, such as those caused by builders or authorities. Accordingly, the Tribunal quashed the disallowance and held that Section 54F relief depends on timely appropriation of funds , not on physical completion or possession. This interpretation aligns with the object of the law—promoting housing investment—while ensuring fairness to assessees. Subramanian Swaminathan v. ACIT [2023] 152 taxmann.com 72 / [2023] 201 ITD 487 (Delhi - Trib.) Q43. Should unutilized funds lying in the Capital Gains Account Scheme be taxed once the statutory three-year period expires, even when delay in construction is solely due to the builder and litigation is pending before the High Court? Ans. The Tribunal ruled in favour of the assessee , holding that: The assessee had already paid a substantial portion (about 64%) of the purchase price, and the balance remained in the Capital Gains Account Scheme. Since construction was halted by the builder and the matter was pending before the High Court, it was a case of impossibility of performance beyond the assessee’s control. Therefore, the unutilized funds could not be forced into taxation immediately after three years. The limitation period for utilization stands extended until resolution of the dispute, and taxation may arise only if the assessee later withdraws or misuses the funds. The Tribunal emphasized that Section 54F is a beneficial provision , meant to provide relief to taxpayers who reinvest their gains in residential housing. It cannot be interpreted harshly where genuine investment intent exists but external circumstances prevent completion. In this case, the assessee had invested about 64% of the purchase price and kept the remaining funds in the Capital Gains Account Scheme, demonstrating a clear intention to reinvest. The difficulty arose solely because the builder stopped construction and failed to deliver possession, forcing the assessee to file a suit before the High Court. The Tribunal observed that taxing the unutilized amount under these circumstances would cause undue hardship , as the assessee was prevented from completing the investment due to factors beyond his control. Relying on precedents like Pr. CIT v. C. Gopalaswamy (Kar. HC), it held that completion or possession is not essential if substantial investment is made. Accordingly, the Tribunal treated the case as one of impossibility of performance and extended the time for utilization until the dispute was resolved. This ensures fairness while preserving the legislative intent of Section 54F—to encourage housing investment, not penalize taxpayers for delays caused by builders. Dhananjay Madhukar Naik v. ITO [2023] 154 taxmann.com 540 / [2023] 203 ITD 30 (Mumbai - Trib.) Q44. Can exemption under Section 54 be allowed on capital gains from sale of a plot of land, or should the correct provision be Section 54F? Ans. The Tribunal ruled in favour of the Revenue , holding that: Exemption under Section 54 applies only to capital gains from transfer of a residential house property (building or land appurtenant thereto). Since the assessee sold a plot of land , Section 54 relief was wrongly allowed by the AO. The PCIT correctly exercised revisionary jurisdiction under Section 263, directing the AO to re-examine the assessee’s eligibility under Section 54F. The assessee’s plea that no prejudice was caused to the Revenue as the exemption quantum was the same under Section 54F could not be accepted, since this required verification. Hence, the revision order was upheld. The Tribunal emphasized that Section 54 and Section 54F operate in distinct spheres . Section 54 applies only when capital gains arise from the transfer of a residential house property , while Section 54F applies when the capital gains arise from transfer of any long-term capital asset other than a residential house . In this case, the asset sold was a plot of land , and therefore exemption under Section 54 was clearly not applicable. The Assessing Officer erred in granting Section 54 relief, and the Principal Commissioner was justified in invoking Section 263 as the assessment order was both erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of Revenue . The assessee’s argument—that even under Section 54F the exemption quantum would have been the same—was rejected, as this required verification of compliance with conditions under Section 54F, such as proportionality rules and restrictions on owning multiple houses. The Tribunal reiterated that procedural correctness in applying the right provision is essential, even if the Revenue suffers no immediate loss. Beneficial provisions like Section 54F must indeed be liberally construed, but only when the statutory preconditions are met. Accordingly, the revision order was upheld, and the assessee’s appeal dismissed. Smt. Janki Kishan Hingorani v. PCIT [2024] 158 taxmann.com 3 (Rajkot - Trib.) Q45. Whether an assessee who mistakenly claims exemption under Section 54 instead of Section 54F can correct the section during assessment without filing a revised return, when the substantive conditions for exemption are satisfied? Ans. The Tribunal ruled in favour of the assessee , holding that: This was not a case of a new claim but a bona fide error of quoting the wrong section . The assessee had in substance claimed exemption on reinvestment of capital gains in residential property, which was valid under Section 54F. A correction of the section at the assessment stage is permissible and qualitatively different from making an entirely fresh claim. Therefore, the assessee was entitled to exemption under Section 54F without filing a revised return. The Tribunal highlighted that the Income-tax Act must be applied with a substantive rather than hyper-technical approach . The object of Sections 54 and 54F is to exempt capital gains when reinvested into residential housing. In this case, the assessee had surrendered tenancy rights (a long-term capital asset other than a residential house), which qualified for Section 54F and not Section 54. However, by mistake, the return reflected a claim under Section 54. The Assessing Officer rejected the claim citing Goetz (India) Ltd. v. CIT (SC), which held that fresh claims cannot be entertained without a revised return. The Tribunal distinguished that ruling, noting that Goetz applied only when a completely new claim was sought to be introduced during assessment. Here, the assessee’s claim was already made, but under the wrong section. Correcting the section was only a technical rectification of a valid claim, not the introduction of a new one. The Tribunal approved the CIT(A)’s reasoning that substance should prevail over form. Since the assessee had invested more than the entire consideration in a new flat, the exemption conditions under Section 54F were fully satisfied. Hence, denial of relief would defeat the beneficial purpose of the provision. ITO (Intl. Taxation) v. Armine Hamied Khan [2022] 142 taxmann.com 14 / [2022] 197 ITD 110 (Mumbai - Trib.) Q46. Does Section 54 relief require the new property to be purchased exclusively in the assessee’s own name, or is investment in the name of a spouse sufficient? Ans. The Tribunal ruled in favour of the assessee , holding that: The sale proceeds were duly invested in the purchase of a new house, and this was supported by bank statements and builder receipts. The registry in the spouse’s name was only for convenience since the assessee was abroad due to Covid-related restrictions. Relying on Delhi High Court rulings ( CIT v. Kamal Wahal and CIT v. Ravinder Kumar Arora ), the Tribunal held that purchase in the spouse’s name still qualifies for Section 54 relief. Thus, the exemption under Section 54 was allowed. The Tribunal emphasized that Sections 54 and 54F are beneficial provisions aimed at promoting reinvestment of capital gains into residential housing. Their interpretation should be purposive and liberal rather than restrictive. The Assessing Officer had adopted a narrow view by insisting that the new property must be registered exclusively in the assessee’s name. However, the Tribunal noted that neither Section 54 nor Section 54F explicitly mandates this. Judicial precedents, particularly from the Delhi High Court in Kamal Wahal and Ravinder Kumar Arora , have consistently held that where an assessee invests the sale proceeds in a house purchased in the spouse’s name, exemption cannot be denied. The rationale is that what matters is the source of funds and the fact of reinvestment, not the technicality of in whose name the sale deed stands. In this case, the assessee had clearly used her sale proceeds to acquire the new property, and the registry in her spouse’s name occurred only because she could not travel to India during Covid restrictions. Denying relief in such circumstances would defeat the legislative intent. Therefore, the Tribunal rightly upheld the assessee’s eligibility for exemption under Section 54. Simran Bagga v. ACIT [2024] 158 taxmann.com 265 / [2024] 205 ITD 100 (Delhi - Trib.) Q47. Can an assessment allowing deduction under Section 54F be reopened under Sections 147/148 without any new tangible material, when all facts were already disclosed during the original scrutiny—amounting only to a change of opinion? Ans. The Bombay High Court ruled in favour of the assessee , holding that: During the original scrutiny, the Assessing Officer had specifically inquired about immovable property transactions, and the assessee had disclosed all details, including the Section 54F claim. The assessment order was passed after considering this material, hence reopening the case later amounted to a mere change of opinion , which is impermissible. Since no failure of disclosure by the assessee was established and no fresh tangible material was brought on record, the reopening notice and subsequent reassessment order were invalid. Accordingly, the notices, reassessment order, and penalty proceedings were quashed. The Court emphasized that the first proviso to Section 147 prohibits reopening of assessments after four years unless there is failure by the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts. In this case, the assessee had, in response to notices during scrutiny, furnished complete details of his property sales, computation of capital gains, and supporting documents for exemption under Section 54F. The AO, having examined these, passed an assessment order allowing the deduction. The Court reiterated that reopening cannot be used as a tool to review or change an earlier opinion of the AO, citing CIT v. Kelvinator of India Ltd. (SC). A mere oversight by the AO in appreciating the same material does not constitute escapement of income due to the assessee’s failure. Moreover, the Revenue failed to provide recorded reasons for reopening to the assessee, violating the principles laid down in GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. v. ITO (SC). Thus, the reopening lacked jurisdictional foundation and was quashed. The judgment safeguards taxpayers from repeated reassessments based only on shifting opinions of tax authorities, reinforcing the principle of finality and certainty in assessments under Section 54F. Ashraf Chitalwala v. DCIT [2023] 155 taxmann.com 137 / [2024] 461 ITR 235 (Bombay HC) Q48. Does joint ownership of more than one residential property disentitle an assessee from claiming exemption under Section 54F of the Income-tax Act, 1961? Ans. The Tribunal ruled in favour of the assessee , holding that: Joint ownership of residential property cannot be equated with absolute ownership . Unless the assessee is the exclusive owner of more than one residential house, Section 54F exemption cannot be denied. Since there was no contrary binding decision from the jurisdictional High Court, the Tribunal followed the favourable rulings of the Madras High Court ( Dr. Smt. P.K. Vasanthi Rangarajan v. CIT ) and coordinate benches. Therefore, the assessee’s claim under Section 54F was allowed. The Tribunal emphasized that the proviso to Section 54F intends to prevent relief where an assessee already owns multiple residential houses, but this condition applies only to full ownership . A co-owner merely holds a fractional interest, which does not amount to ownership of a “residential house” in the sense contemplated by the proviso. Judicial precedents, including Dr. Smt. P.K. Vasanthi Rangarajan (Madras HC) and several ITAT rulings, have consistently held that joint ownership does not disentitle a taxpayer from claiming Section 54F relief. In this case, the assessee had sold agricultural land and deposited the capital gains in the Capital Gains Account Scheme before investing in a new flat, thereby satisfying the core requirements of Section 54F. The Revenue’s reliance on the Karnataka High Court ruling in M.J. Siwani v. CIT was rejected because the Supreme Court had dismissed the SLP without laying down binding law, and more favourable interpretations existed. Following the principle laid down in CIT v. Vegetable Products Ltd. (SC), where two interpretations are possible, the one beneficial to the assessee must prevail. Thus, the Tribunal rightly allowed the deduction, reinforcing that beneficial provisions like Section 54F must be construed liberally to fulfil their purpose. Shweta Singh v. ITO [2024] 161 taxmann.com 302 (Mumbai - Trib.) Q49. Is exemption under Section 54F available to an assessee for investment in a residential house outside India (USA) prior to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2014 amendment restricting such investment to properties situated ‘in India’? Ans. The Bombay High Court ruled in favour of the assessee , holding that: The amendment requiring investment “in India” is prospective from 1-4-2015. For AY 2014-15, the unamended Section 54F applied, which simply required investment in “a residential house” without geographic restriction. Since the assessee had duly invested the sale proceeds in a house in the USA within the prescribed period, he satisfied the statutory conditions and was entitled to exemption. The Revenue’s reliance on Section 5(2) and its claim that the amendment was clarificatory and retrospective was rejected. The Court emphasized that statutory amendments are to be treated as prospective unless expressly or necessarily retrospective. Before the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2014, Section 54F only required that capital gains be invested in “a residential house,” with no condition restricting such house to India. By inserting the words “in India” w.e.f. 1-4-2015, Parliament imposed a new substantive condition. Since the pre-amended law was neither vague nor ambiguous, the amendment could not be treated as clarificatory. The Court also noted that Section 5(2), which speaks of income accruing or arising “in India,” cannot override the specific language of Section 54F. The scheme of exemption provisions shows that the focus is on reinvestment of gains into residential housing, and prior to 2015 this relief extended even to property purchased abroad. The legislative intent of the amendment was to restrict such benefits going forward, not retrospectively. Accordingly, as the assessee had sold a residential flat in India and invested the capital gains in a residential flat in the USA within the statutory time limit, he had complied with Section 54F as it stood. The denial of exemption was therefore unjustified, and the assessee’s claim was allowed. Hemant Dinkar Kandlur v. CIT (International Taxation) [2023] 155 taxmann.com 493 / [2024] 462 ITR 67 (Bombay HC) Q50. Can exemption under Section 54F be granted when the new residential property is registered in the names of the assessee’s parents, but the investment is entirely made from the assessee’s own funds and the property is later gifted back to him? Ans. The Tribunal ruled in favour of the assessee , holding that: The investments for the new property were made by the assessee from his own bank account. The property was registered in his parents’ names only because the assessee was abroad at the time of registration. Subsequently, the property was gifted back to the assessee by his parents, confirming his ownership. Relying on purposive interpretation and precedents like CIT v. Kamal Wahal , the Tribunal upheld the CIT(A)’s decision allowing exemption under Section 54F. The Tribunal applied the rule of purposive construction , emphasizing that Section 54F is a beneficial provision aimed at encouraging reinvestment of capital gains in residential housing. Its object would be defeated if genuine investments are denied relief merely due to technicalities such as whose name appears on the purchase deed. What matters is the source of funds and the assessee’s beneficial ownership, not the formality of registration. In this case, the assessee sold a residential house and invested the entire sale proceeds in buying another property. The payments were made directly from his bank account, establishing that he was the real investor. The property was registered in his parents’ names only because of his absence from India, a practical necessity. Later, his parents formally gifted the property back to him, confirming the arrangement. Courts, including the Delhi High Court in CIT v. Kamal Wahal and ACIT v. Suresh Verma , have consistently held that exemption cannot be denied if the purchase is made in the name of a spouse or close family member, provided the funds belong to the assessee. Following this principle, the Tribunal allowed the exemption under Section 54F, ensuring the legislative intent was fulfilled. Rajiv Ghai v. ACIT [2024] 160 taxmann.com 509 / [2024] 109 ITR(T) 439 (Delhi - Trib.) The date of possession of the new flat (24-12-2018) is the relevant date of purchase for the purpose of Section 54, not merely the agreement date. At the time of agreement in 2016, the flat was not yet constructed; the assessee only had a right to acquire it in future. Relying on CIT v. Beena K. Jain (Bom. HC), the Tribunal clarified that acquisition is complete only when the property is ready, full consideration is paid, and possession is handed over. Since possession was within two months of selling the old bungalow (23-10-2018), the assessee satisfied Section 54 conditions and was entitled to exemption. Section 54F requires that the capital gains be invested in purchase or construction within the prescribed time, not that construction must be fully completed or possession handed over. In this case, payments for purchase of property and construction were duly made within the time limit, and that too from the Capital Gains Account. Hence, denial of exemption merely on the ground that construction was incomplete was without merit. The assessee was entitled to deduction under Section 54F. The assessee had already paid a substantial portion (about 64%) of the purchase price, and the balance remained in the Capital Gains Account Scheme. Since construction was halted by the builder and the matter was pending before the High Court, it was a case of impossibility of performance beyond the assessee’s control.

        "content": "Tax News-12 Based on case laws uploaded in August 2025 1. ITAT Ahmedabad Remands Case on Bogus Purchases for Verification of GST ITC and Genuineness of Transactions ITO v. Ramlal Manekchand HUF [2025 (8) TMI 1332 – ITAT Ahmedabad] The issue concerned additions on account of unexplained purchases under section 769C . The assessee, engaged in bullion and jewellery trading, had shown purchases worth ₹25.17 crore from five parties. The AO, based on Designated Verification Unit reports, found two suppliers working as labourers/furniture workers and three others untraceable. Purchases from the first two were treated as unexplained expenditure (₹16.13 crore net addition), while 10% profit element was added on purchases from the other three parties (₹89.41 lakh). CIT(A) deleted additions relying on invoices, ledgers, and bank entries, without addressing the adverse evidences. On appeal, the Tribunal observed that a crucial aspect—the status of GST input tax credit (ITC) on these purchases involving ₹75.51 lakh GST—was neither examined by AO nor CIT(A). Since ITC reconciliation could establish genuineness or otherwise, the Tribunal restored the matter to AO for fresh verification, including suppliers’ GST returns, bank accounts, and fund trail. 2. ITAT Ahmedabad Reduces Penalty under Section 271(1)(b) for Non-compliance with Notices Harshadkumar Bhogilal Raval v. ITO [2025 (8) TMI 1331 – ITAT Ahmedabad] The assessee challenged penalty proceedings under section 271(1)(b) for failure to comply with notices issued under section 142(1) . The assessee had initially responded to the first notice with an adjournment request but failed to comply with two subsequent notices (31.03.2021 and 16.08.2021). He argued that non-compliance was due to the Covid-19 pandemic and cited the Supreme Court’s suo motu extension of limitation. The Tribunal observed that the SC extension applied to filing of appeals, not to compliance with assessment notices, and that the assessee adopted a casual approach by neither responding to penalty notices nor filing submissions. However, it also held that penalty under section 271(1)(b) is ₹10,000 per default , and for multiple failures, separate notices must be issued. Since AO imposed a consolidated penalty of ₹20,000 without separate initiation, the Tribunal reduced the penalty to ₹10,000. 3. ITAT Mumbai Upholds Late Fee under Section 234E for Post-2015 TDS Default Hi Techno Control System Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT (Appeals) [2025 (8) TMI 1320 – ITAT Mumbai] The assessee challenged a levy of late filing fee for delayed filing of TDS return. Initially, the matter arose from an appeal against an alleged order under section 272A(2)(K) dated 19.02.2020. On revenue’s Miscellaneous Application, the Tribunal found that no such order existed. Instead, intimation under sections 154 and 200A/206CB dated 30.03.2017 had imposed a late fee of ₹85,200 for delay in filing TDS statement for Q3 of FY 2015-16 (AY 2016-17). The assessee relied on Bathline India Pvt. Ltd. (ITAT Delhi) and Fatehraj Singhvi (Karnataka HC), where levy of fee was held unsustainable for periods prior to 01.06.2015 , the effective date of section 200A(1)(c). However, the Tribunal noted that the present default (Oct–Dec 2015) was post-01.06.2015 , making the levy legally valid. Hence, the ITAT upheld CIT(A)’s order confirming the late fee under section 234E r.w.s. 200A , and dismissed the assessee’s appeal. 4. Bombay High Court Allows Set-off of Interest Expenditure Against Interest Income – Commencement of Business from Preparation Stage Modi Business Centre Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT [2025 (8) TMI 1285 – Bombay HC] The issue was whether interest paid on Citibank loans could be set off against interest income earned by advancing part of those borrowed funds to sister concerns in AY 1992-93. The Assessing Officer treated the interest receipt as “income from other sources” and disallowed set-off, holding that business had not commenced. The ITAT upheld this view. The High Court disagreed, holding that for income-tax purposes, business commences not merely on actual letting but from the preparatory stage of acquiring, repairing, and furnishing property for letting. Citing Sarabhai Management Corp. (SC), the Court ruled that lending money to sister concerns was part of the assessee’s business objects under its MoA, and similar treatment had been accepted in later years (AYs 1993-94 to 1995-96). To ensure consistency, AY 1992-93 also had to be treated likewise. Accordingly, the HC set aside ITAT’s order and restored the CIT(A)’s decision allowing set-off under section 36(1)(iii) . 5. SLP Dismissed – Delay in Filing Form 10B Condonable, Filing is Directory Not Mandatory Addl./Jt./Dy./Asstt. CIT/ITO v. Shilparamam Arts Crafts and Cultural Society [2025] 177 taxmann.com 282 (SC) The Supreme Court dismissed Revenue’s SLP filed with a delay of 488 days against the Telangana High Court judgment. The assessee, a trust registered under section 12A, had filed its return of income for AY 2017-18 within time but uploaded Form 10B belatedly , though before the assessment order was passed. The High Court held that section 119(2)(b) empowers authorities to condone delay where genuine hardship is caused and does not prescribe any rigid limitation for filing such an application. Further, filing of audit report in Form 10B is only directory, not mandatory, especially when the return itself was filed on time. Since the audit report was available before completion of assessment, condonation should have been granted. The Supreme Court, noting both the delay in SLP filing and absence of merit, dismissed the petition, thereby affirming relief to the assessee. 6. Bogus LTCG from Penny Stock – Treated as Unexplained Cash Credit under Section 68 Jelly Samkit Doshi v. ITO [2025] 177 taxmann.com 78 (Ahmedabad – Trib.) The assessee claimed exemption under section 10(38) on alleged long-term capital gains from sale of shares of Kappac Pharma Ltd. The shares were acquired in cash through an off-market transaction in physical form, later dematerialised and sold at a huge price escalation. The AO, relying on investigation reports into penny stock scams, held the transaction as a pre-arranged accommodation entry to convert unaccounted money into tax-free LTCG. The assessee had no past or subsequent trading activity , limited income sources (mainly tuition fees in cash), and insufficient liquidity to justify the cash investment. The Tribunal noted suspicious gaps between purchase and transfer, cash acquisition, tainted scrip, and implausible price rise, which failed the test of human probabilities (relying on Durga Prasad More and Sumati Dayal ). Accordingly, the LTCG claim was rejected and the addition under section 68 , taxable u/s 115BBE , was upheld. 7. ITAT Delhi on AMP, Comparables, Interest on Receivables & DDT – Relief Partly Granted to Sony India (P.) Ltd. Sony India (P.) Ltd. v. ACIT [2025] 177 taxmann.com 325 (Delhi - Trib.) Multiple issues were decided across AYs 2015-16, 2017-18 & 2018-19. The Tribunal held that adjustments to Advertising, Marketing and Promotion (AMP) expenses are impermissible either through the Bright Line Test (BLT) or the so-called intensity approach , relying on Sony Ericsson Mobile and subsequent Delhi HC rulings. On comparables for advisory services , a company lacking complete public financials and functionally different was excluded. Regarding interest on delayed receivables , the TPO’s computation beyond the relevant AY (till 31-1-2021) was remanded for fresh verification. On Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) , the assessee’s claim of DTAA benefit under the India–Netherlands treaty was rejected, as per the Mumbai Special Bench in Total Oil India (P.) Ltd. , holding DTAA does not apply to DDT unless explicitly extended. Overall, AMP and comparables issues were decided in favour of the assessee, DDT against it, and interest adjustment remanded. 8. Remand of Second Application for Registration under Section 12AB in Light of CBDT Circular No. 7/2024 Bethany Tamil Congregation Trust v. CIT (Exemption) [2025] 177 taxmann.com 183 (Pune - Trib.) The ITAT Pune dealt with the issue of rejection of a second application for registration under section 12AB. The assessee’s first application under section 12AB r.w.s. 12A(1)(ac) was rejected, and its provisional registration was also cancelled. Subsequently, the assessee filed a fresh application citing CBDT Circular No. 7/2024 dated 25-4-2024 , which had expressly provided another opportunity to trusts and institutions whose earlier applications were rejected. The Commissioner (Exemption) again rejected the application, holding that once provisional registration was cancelled, the assessee was disentitled to seek fresh registration. The Tribunal noted that the Circular’s intent was to grant a one-time relaxation, enabling re-application even where earlier registration was cancelled. Therefore, the Commissioner was not justified in summarily rejecting the second application. The matter was remanded to the Commissioner (Exemption) for fresh adjudication after affording due opportunity. Matter remanded; in favour of assessee. 9. Transfer Pricing Adjustments on Comparables, Foreign Exchange Gains, and Technical Fee Calsonic Kansei Motherson Auto Products (P.) Ltd. v. ACIT [2025] 177 taxmann.com 169 (Delhi - Trib.) The assessee, engaged in manufacturing HVAC systems and compressors for automobiles, contested TP adjustments made by the TPO for AY 2020-21. It argued for inclusion of certain comparables earlier accepted by the TPO and exclusion of those functionally dissimilar, having huge intangibles, engaged in R&D, or receiving government grants. The Tribunal directed inclusion of Gajjar Compressors, Swan Pneumatics, Emerson Climate, Frick India, NHK Spring, and others, while excluding Banco Products, PPAP Automotive, and Sansera Engineering. It further held that foreign exchange gains/losses form part of operating revenue following Delhi High Court’s ruling in B.C. Management Services (P.) Ltd. Payment of technical assistance fee to AE was justified since services were evidenced and amount was reasonable relative to turnover. On delayed receivables, Tribunal applied LIBOR +200 bps with a 60-day credit period. Overall, substantive TP additions were deleted, and appeal was decided in favour of assessee. 10. Appeal Dismissed as Withdrawn under Vivad se Vishwas Scheme Yum! Restaurants (India) (P.) Ltd. v. CIT [2025] 177 taxmann.com 360 (SC) The assessee, Yum! Restaurants (India) (P.) Ltd. , was engaged in managing franchisees of Pizza Hut and KFC in India. For AY 2001-02, it claimed deduction of accrued marketing expenditure under a franchisee incentive scheme, and also deduction of contributions made to its wholly owned subsidiary for advertisement and marketing. The AO disallowed part of these claims, which was upheld by appellate authorities and the Delhi High Court. The High Court held that the accrued marketing expenditure was not deductible in the relevant year since the scheme was notified to franchisees only later, and contributions to subsidiary were not made out of commercial expediency. On further appeal, the assessee submitted that disputes had been settled under the Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, 2024. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal as withdrawn, leaving all contentions open. Thus, the matter was closed without adjudication on merits.",
