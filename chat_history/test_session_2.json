The Tribunal noted that the assessee later provided additional evidence, including a share certificate from the Co-operative Housing Society, a seller\u2019s ledger account confirming full payment, and a letter of possession from the seller Income tax Q and A-16, page 0. Since the Assessing Officer (AO) or Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) (CIT(A)) had not considered these documents, the Tribunal remanded the issue back to the AO for a fresh examination.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe case involved an assessee claiming Section 54F exemption despite an unexecuted sale deed and partial payment. The Tribunal sent the case back to the AO for re-examination due to new evidence, including a share certificate, proof of full payment, and a possession letter, which had not been previously considered.",
