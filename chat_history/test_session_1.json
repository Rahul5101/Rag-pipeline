The assessee, who acted as a mediator for Sahara City Homes, had their profit estimated at 20% by the Assessing Officer based on a letter, which the Tribunal upheld. The Tribunal noted that seized material corroborated this profit margin. It was also determined that once income is estimated, further disallowances under Sections 40A(3) or 37(1) are not warranted. Unexplained expenditure was allowed to be telescoped against disclosed income, and interest income from seized documents was taxed in the current year. However, additions for notional interest and unsupported unexplained cash deposits, as well as additions based solely on loose papers without corroboration, were deleted Tax News-5, page 0.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe ITAT Ahmedabad ruled that profit estimation in Sahara Land Dealings should be restricted to 20%. The Tribunal upheld the Assessing Officer's 20% profit estimation for a mediator, supported by seized evidence. It also clarified that further disallowances are unwarranted once income is estimated, and deleted additions for notional interest and unsupported cash deposits.",
